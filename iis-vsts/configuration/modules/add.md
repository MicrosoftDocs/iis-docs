Adding Modules &lt;add&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<add>` element of the `<modules>` element adds a module to the collection of feature modules that are available in IIS Manager when a user is connected to a site or an application.

> [!NOTE]
> This collection of modules is specific to IIS Manager and should not be confused with the [&lt;system.webServer/modules&gt;](../system.webserver/modules/index.md) collection, which defines modules that affect HTTP request processing.

> [!NOTE]
> The settings in the `<modules>` element can only be configured in the Administration.config file.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample configuration excerpt has been shortened for easier reading.

[!code-xml[Main](add/samples/sample1.xml)]

The following sample configuration excerpt from the Administration.config file specifies custom `<modules>` elements for the Default Web Site and a child application by defining unique `<location>` elements that clear the default module lists and define the specific modules that will be respectively enabled for each location. When a remote administration connects to either location, IIS Manager will only display those features that are represented by the modules that are listed in each `<location>` element.
