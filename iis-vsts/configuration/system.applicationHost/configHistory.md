Configuration History &lt;configHistory&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<configHistory>` element defines the settings for the built-in IIS configuration history feature, which keeps a running history of changes to your configuration files. This history is especially useful for recovering from mistakes made when manually editing your configuration files.

For example, if you were making changes to your ApplicationHost.config file and the changes contained invalid syntax, end users would see the following error when browsing to your Web site:

**HTTP Error 503. The service is unavailable.**

To resolve the issue, you would only need to copy the ApplicationHost.config from the history folder into your %*windir*%\system32\inetsrv\config folder in order to restore your server to operational state.

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration history feature requires that the **Application Host Help Service** is running on your server; if this service is stopped or disabled, changes to your configuration files will not be kept in the history folder.
