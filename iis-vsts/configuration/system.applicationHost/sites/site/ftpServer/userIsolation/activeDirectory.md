FTP Active Directory User Isolation &lt;activeDirectory&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<activeDirectory>` element specifies the credentials and connection time-out for communicating with an Active Directory server for FTP user isolation. This option is the same as choosing Active Directory user isolation in the IIS 6.0 FTP server, where a user's account must have the **msIIS-FTPRoot** and **msIIS-FTPDir** properties configured in their Active Directory objects.

- If the FTP service successfully accesses the path that is specified by the **msIIS-FTPRoot** and **msIIS-FTPDir** properties, it becomes the home directory for the user and the user cannot access the file system outside this directory. - If the FTP service cannot access the path that is specified by the **msIIS-FTPRoot** and **msIIS-FTPDir** properties, or either of the **msIIS-FTPRoot** or **msIIS-FTPDir** properties do not exist, the user is denied access.

For additional information about how to configure the Active Director properties, see the "Isolate Users Using Active Directory Mode" section in the [Hosting Multiple FTP Sites with FTP User Isolation (IIS 6.0)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=99787) topic.

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The `<activeDirectory>` element was not modified in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<activeDirectory>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<activeDirectory>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<activeDirectory>` element of the `<userIsolation>` element ships as a feature of IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<activeDirectory>` element of the `<userIsolation>` element was introduced in FTP 7.0, which was a separate download for IIS 7.0. |
| IIS 6.0 | N/A |

> [!NOTE]
> The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the modules from the following URL:

> [https://www.iis.net/expand/FTP](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp)


With Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5, so downloading the FTP service is no longer necessary.
