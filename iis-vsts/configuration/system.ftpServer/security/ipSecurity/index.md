FTP IP Security &lt;ipSecurity&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<ipSecurity>` element defines a list of IP-based security restrictions in FTP 7. These restrictions can be based on the IP version 4 address, a range of IP version 4 addresses, or a DNS domain name.

<a id="002"></a>
## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The `<ipSecurity>` element was not modified in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<ipSecurity>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<ipSecurity>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<ipSecurity>` element of the `<system.ftpServer/security>` element ships as a feature of IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<ipSecurity>` element of the `<system.ftpServer/security>` element was introduced in FTP 7.0, which was a separate download for IIS 7.0. |
| IIS 6.0 | N/A |

> [!NOTE]
> The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the modules from the following URL:

> [https://www.iis.net/expand/FTP](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp)


With Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5, so downloading the FTP service is no longer necessary.

## Configuration

The `<ipSecurity>` element is configured at the site or URL level.

Rules are processed from top to bottom, in the order they appear in the list. The **allowunlisted** attribute is processed last. Best practice for Internet Protocol security (IPsec) restrictions is to list Deny rules first. You cannot clear the **allowunlisted** attribute if it is set to **false**.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `allowUnlisted` | Optional **Boolean** attribute.<br><br>Specifies whether to allow unlisted IP addresses. Setting the **allowUnlisted** attribute to **true** allows an unlisted IP address to access the server. Setting the **allowUnlisted** attribute to **false** locks down the server, preventing access to all IP address unless they are listed. If you set this attribute to false and do not list the local loopback address (127.0.0.1) as an allowed IP address, you will not be able to access your server by using a browser from a local console.<br><br>The default value is `true`. |
| `enableReverseDns` | Optional **Boolean** attribute.<br><br>Specifies whether to enable or disable reverse Domain Name System (DNS) lookups for the FTP server. Reverse lookups involve looking up the domain name when the IP address is known.<br><br>**Caution**: Reverse DNS lookups will use significant resources and time.<br><br>The default value is `false`. |

### Child Elements

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`add`](add.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Adds an IP restriction to the collection of IP address restrictions. |
| `remove` | Optional element.<br><br>Removes a reference to a restriction from the `<ipSecurity>` collection. |
| `clear` | Optional element.<br><br>Removes all references to restrictions from the `<ipSecurity>` collection. |

### Configuration Sample

The following sample illustrates several security-related configuration settings in the `<system.ftpServer>` element for an FTP site. More specifically, the `<location>` settings in this example demonstrate how to:

- Specify an FTP authorization rule for read and write access for the administrators group.
- Specify FTP request filtering options that deny \*.exe, \*.bat, and \*.cmd files.
- Specify FTP request limits for a maximum content length of 1000000 bytes and a maximum URL length of 1024 bytes.
- Block FTP access to the \_vti\_bin virtual directory, which is used with the FrontPage Server Extensions.
- Specify FTP IP filtering options that allow access from 127.0.0.1 and deny access from the 169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0 range of IP addresses.

## Sample Code

The following examples configure FTP IP security to allow unlisted IP addresses, then specify IP restrictions that allow access from 127.0.0.1 and deny access from the 169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0 range of IP addresses.

### AppCmd.exe

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
