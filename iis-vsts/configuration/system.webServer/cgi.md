CGI &lt;cgi&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<cgi>` element configures default settings for Common Gateway Interface (CGI) applications for Internet Information Services (IIS) 7. These settings define the environment that IIS 7 will use when launching CGI processes. For example, the **createCGIWithNewConsole** and **createProcessAsUser** attributes specify how IIS 7 will launch a CGI application, and the **timeout** attribute specifies how long IIS will let a CGI application run before terminating the process.

CGI is sometimes considered to be a legacy application environment. Because of the processing overhead that is associated with launching CGI applications as separate processes, technologies like HTTP Modules, ISAPI extensions, ASP/ASP.NET, and FastCGI are preferred over CGI for application development.

> [!NOTE]
> The CGI environment is not installed by default; however, installing the CGI environment also installs the necessary functionality for using FastCGI applications. For more information about using FastCGI on IIS 7, see the [&lt;fastCgi&gt;](fastcgi/index.md) element.

## Configuration

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `createCGIWithNewConsole` | Optional Boolean attribute. <br><br>Specifies whether a CGI application runs in its own console. <br><br>**Note:** If the value is set to **true**, each CGI application creates a new console when the application is started. A value of **false** indicates that CGI applications should run without a console. <br><br>The default value is `false`. |
| `createProcessAsUser` | Optional Boolean attribute. <br><br>Specifies whether a CGI process is created in the system context or in the context of the requesting user. <br><br>The default value is `true`. |
| `timeout` | Optional timeSpan attribute. <br><br>Specifies the time-out for a CGI application. <br><br>The default value is `00:15:00` (15 minutes) |

### Child Elements

None.

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration sample specifies that each CGI application creates a new console when the application starts, that CGI processes be created in the context of the requesting user, and that the time-out for CGI applications is 20 minutes.
