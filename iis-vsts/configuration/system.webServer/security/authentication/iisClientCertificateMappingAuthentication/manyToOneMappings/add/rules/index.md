Many-To-One Mappings Rules &lt;rules&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<rules>` element of the `<add>` element specifies criteria for mapping client certificates with IIS so that many clients can use one certificate.

There are two fields from client certificates that can be used as criteria for many-to-one rules:

- **Issuer** - This field specifies information about the certification authority (CA) that issued the client certificate.
- **Subject** - This field specifies information about the entity to whom the client certificate was issued.

Each of these fields can contain common LDAP sub fields; for example:

- CN = commonName (for example, &quot;Nancy Davolio&quot;)
- OU = organizationalUnitName (for example, &quot;Sales&quot;)
- O = organizationName (for example, &quot;Contoso&quot;)
- L = localityName (for example, &quot;Redmond&quot;)
- S = stateOrProvinceName (for example, &quot;WA&quot;)
- C = countryName (for example, &quot;US&quot;)

To create a mapping, you create a rule based on a field/subfield pair for a specific value. For example, you could create a rule that matched the issuer's O subfield with Contoso to allow access to all clients with certificates that were issued by the Contoso CA. This effectively eliminates client connections from any clients that are not part of the Contoso organization.

## Configuration

### Attributes

None.

### Child Elements

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`add`](add.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Adds a rule to the collection of rules. |
| `clear` | Optional element.<br><br>Removes all references to rules from the rules collection. |

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration sample performs the following actions for the Default Web Site:

- Enables IIS Client Certificate Mapping authentication using many-to-one certificate mapping.
- Creates a many-to-one certificate mapping rule for a user account based on the organization field in the subject of the client certificate matching Contoso.
- Configures the site to require SSL and to negotiate client certificates.
