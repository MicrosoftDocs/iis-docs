With just a few mouse clicks the Windows Web Application Gallery lets you select, download and install popular web applications like blogs, content management systems, wikis or media galleries onto Azure. The following FAQ describes additional information that you may need when you are configuring several popular applications on Azure.

If &quot;Setup&quot; is not clicked and you browse the site you may see this error. This occurs since the app is not configured yet. To resolve this append install.php to the URL and run this script; for example [http://mysitename.azurewebsites.net/install.php](http://mysitename.azurewebsites.net/install.php)
