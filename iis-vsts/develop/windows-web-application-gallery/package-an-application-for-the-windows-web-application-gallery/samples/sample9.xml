   <!-- General Note - If you are using MySQL, you will need to change 
  the "SQL" tag to "MySQL" for all of the parameters below.-->   

   <!-- The Database Server parameter is used to identify the database 
  server that the Web Deployment Tool will connect to for execution of 
  the SQL script(s) required for installation. For SQL (Express or 
  Server) this field points to the server and database instance being 
  used. Typically, this will be './SQLEXPRESS' or './SQLSERVER', where 
  the '.' specifies the local machine, and 'SQLEXPRESS' and 
  'SQLSERVER' are the default instance names. For MySQL Databases, the 
  Database Server will be a host name for the system that the database 
  is running on. In many cases, this will be 'localhost' to specify 
  that MySQL is running on the local machine. -->   

   <parameter   
     name = "dbServer"   
     defaultValue = ".\SQLEXPRESS"   
     tags = "SQL, dbServer" >   
   </parameter>   

   <!-- The Database Name parameter specifies the name of the database 
  on the server that will be used by the application. If this database 
  doesn't exist, the Web Deployment Tool will attempt to create it 
  using the specified credentials. This parameter can also be applied 
  to configuration files or SQL scripts as needed.-->   

   <parameter   
     name = "dbName"   
     defaultValue = "Application"   
     tags = "SQL, dbName" >   
     <parameterEntry   
       type = "TextFile"   
       scope = "install.sql"   
       match = "PlaceholderForDbName"  />   
   </parameter>   

   <!-- Prompts for the database username and fills it into the 
  database scripts. The SQL tag indicates it is a parameter required 
  for SQL, the DbUsername tag indicates this is a Db username Note 
  that this is the User Name that the application uses to communicate 
  with the database. If the user does not exist prior to the 
  installation, this user will be created by the install.sql scripts. 
  -->   

   <parameter   
     name = "dbUsername"   
     defaultValue = "ApplicationUser"   
     tags = "SQL, dbUsername" >   
     <parameterEntry   
       type = "TextFile"

       match = "PlaceholderForDbUsername"  />   
   </parameter>   

   <!-- Prompts for the database password and fills it into the 
  database scripts. The SQL tag indicates it is a parameter required 
  for SQL, the DbUserPassword tag indicates this is a Db password. 
  Since this is a new password being set for SQL or SQL Express, we 
  use a Regular Expression validationString to make sure that the 
  password meets the minimum complexity requirements. This Regular 
  Expression ensures that Passwords will contain at least (1) upper 
  case letter, at least (1) lower case letter, at least (1) number or 
  special character, and be least (8) characters in length. While 
  MySQL does not have password strength restrictions by default, it is 
  considered a good security practice to enforce this minimum level of 
  password complexity for MySQL as well. -->   

   <parameter   
     name = "dbUserPassword"   
     tags = "New, Password, SQL, dbUserPassword" >   
     <parameterValidation

   </parameter>   

   <!-- Prompts for the Database Administrator's user name. This is 
  'sa' by default for SQL, and 'root' by default for MySQL. When using 
  the Web PI, the user will only be prompted for this information if 
  the user is creating a new database for the application. If the user 
  is specifying an existing database to use, then the Database 
  Username and Password are substituted for the Administrator's 
  credentials to run the SQL scripts. -->   

   <parameter   
     name = "dbAdminUsername"   
     defaultValue = "sa"   
     tags = "SQL, dbAdminUsername" >   
   </parameter>   

   <!-- Prompts for the Database Administrator's password. This is used 
  in conjunction with the Database Administrator's user name under the 
  same circumstances. The SQL tag indicates it is a parameter required 
  for SQL. The DbAdminPassword tag indicates it should be used when 
  the user is creating a new database. -->   

   <parameter   
     name = "dbAdminPassword"   
     tags = "Password, SQL, dbAdminPassword" >   
   </parameter>   

   <!-- This is the hidden database connection string used to run the 
  database scripts. The SQLConnectionString tag identifies this as a 
  connection string for SQL or SQL Express to the UI. The Validate tag 
  tells the UI to validate that this connection string works before 
  proceeding with the rest of the installation. The credentials used 
  for this connection string are the Administrative credentials if the 
  user is creating a new database, and the application user's 
  credentials if the user is not. Note that when using any 
  installation mechanism other than the WebPI, this connection string 
  will use the Administrative credentials only.-->
