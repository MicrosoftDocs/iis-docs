  <!-- iisapp path identifies the subdirectory in the ZIP file which
  contains all of the application files 
  -->
  <iisApp path="wordpress" />
  <!-- dbmysql path identifies the SQL script file that will be executed
  for database setup.  In this app's case, the script is being used
  to create the database user for the application

  <!-- alias is used to make a copy of a distribution file to a location
  where it will be used.  Note that when you specify the Application
  name in the "to" attribute, you should specify the full path using
  the value of iisapp above for the root.  Alias doesn't actually
  copy the file within the package.  It creates an alias to the 
  original file using the new file's path and name.  This alias then
  gets copied to the file system as if it were a real file within
  the package
  -->
    <alias from="wordpress/wp-config-sample.php" to="wordpress/wp-config.php" />
 
  <!-- setAcl with a setAclResourceType of "File" is used to set the access
  privileges for a file within the application.  In this case, the 
  ACL is being set on the configuration file that was created after the
  alias above was copied to disk.  This will enable the application to
  write to the configuration file as needed.  
  We highly recommend setting Writable permission to only those directories that require this permission  setting.
  -->
  
  <setAcl 
    path="wordpress/wp-content"   
    setAclAccess="Modify"
    setAclUser="anonymousAuthenticationUser" 
    />
  <!-- setAcl with no setAclResourceType set will default to setting an ACL
  on a directory.  We are setting an ACL here for the files directory.
  This directory is used to store files that are uploaded for the 
  application
  -->
  <!-- NOTE - with setAcl, the setAclUser can be explicitly set, or you can
  use the alias 'anonymousAuthenticationUser'.  This should be used in
  all situations, unless your application has a dependency on a specific
  OS user for access to these resources.

  Modify access includes Read and Write as well.  For a full breakdown
