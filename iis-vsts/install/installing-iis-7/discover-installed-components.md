Discover Installed Components
====================
by IIS Team

## Introduction

The modular architecture in IIS 7.0 and above allows you to limit the potential attack surface on your IIS installation, or to replace built-in features with third-party or custom implementations. In general, this architecture offers you an the ability to control how you deploy IIS on your network.

But if there is a downside to this modular architecture, it is that you can no longer be certain every IIS component you need is available, just because IIS has been installed. You might also discover that making sure multiple servers all have the same IIS components can be a chore.

To work around these issues, we are publishing a list of registry keys that show whether any given IIS module has been installed. Use these registry keys to programmatically check on IIS components. If a component has been installed, the registry key has a DWORD value of 00000001. If a component has never been installed or has been uninstalled, the registry key does not exist. Use the table below to match IIS component names with their registry keys.

## Registry Keys

These keys appear in the following registry hive:
