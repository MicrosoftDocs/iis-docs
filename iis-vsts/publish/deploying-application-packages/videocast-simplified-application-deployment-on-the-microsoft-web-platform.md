Videocast: Simplified Application Deployment on the Microsoft Web Platform
====================
by IIS Team

Mai-lan Tomsen Bukovec has published a series of videos that target developers and users who want to experience a simplified deployment experience for apps and the Web stack on Windows, focusing particularly on ASP.NET and PHP open source community applications.

## For developers

- **Make sure that you have the latest Microsoft Web platform tools** (including the Microsoft Web server, applications and frameworks, database and tools, as well as PHP), watch the [Staying Current with the Latest Web Platform with Web Platform Installer](https://blogs.iis.net/mailant/archive/2009/05/02/real-world-iis-staying-current-with-the-latest-microsoft-web-platform-with-web-platform-installer-videocast.aspx) videocast (7 minutes).
- **Add required Web Deployment tool integration for the Windows Web App Gallery** and/or simplify installation on Windows, watch [Adding Web Deployment Tool Support to Community Application Zip Packages](https://blogs.iis.net/mailant/archive/2009/05/04/real-world-iis-adding-web-deployment-tool.aspx) (12 minutes). This video explains how to add Web Deployment Tool manifest files to a community application zip file (WordPress in this case) for easier deployment on Windows.
- **Find a community application that deploys easily on Windows and learn how to re-package that app with customizations** for deployment to a rstrongote IIS Web server, see the [Packaging and Deploying an Open Source Application Using Web Deployment Tool](https://blogs.iis.net/mailant/archive/2009/05/01/real-world-iis-packaging-and-deploying-an-open-source-application-using-web-deployment-tool-screencast.aspx) videocast (11 minutes). This video walks through how to find and customize SilverStripe from the Web App Gallery, then re-package and deploy the customized SilverStripe package using Web Deployment Tool to a remote IIS server.

## For Windows users

- **Try out the Web Platform Installer**, start with the [Finding and Installing the Web Platform Installer 2.0](https://blogs.iis.net/mailant/archive/2009/04/30/real-world-iis-finding-and-installing-web-platform-installer-2-0.aspx) videocast (3 minutes). This video showing the different ways to find and install the Web Platform Installer, as well as provides a brief introduction to the Web Platform Installer Tool.
- ***Install a free open source community application*** easily on Windows, watch the [Installing a Free Community Application Using Web Platform Installer](https://blogs.iis.net/mailant/archive/2009/04/30/real-world-iis-installing-a-free-community-application-using-web-platform-installer-videocast.aspx) videocast (7 minutes).
