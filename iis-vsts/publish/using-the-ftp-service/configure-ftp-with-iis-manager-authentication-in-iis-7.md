Configure FTP with IIS Manager Authentication in IIS 7
====================
by [Robert McMurray](https://github.com/rmcmurray)

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 7.5 | The FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5 in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. |
| IIS 7.0 | The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services were shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the service from the following URL: [https://www.iis.net/download/FTP](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp). |

## Introduction

Microsoft has completely rewritten a new FTP service for Windows ServerÂ® 2008. This FTP service incorporates many new features that enable web authors to publish content better than before, and offers web administrators more security and deployment options.

This document walks you through configuring FTP authentication for IIS 7 Manager accounts in two ways: using the new FTP user interface and by directly editing the IIS 7 configuration files. It contains:

- [Prerequisites](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7.md#01)
- [Configuring the IIS 7 Management Service](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7.md#02)
- [Creating a New FTP Site and Configuring an IIS 7 Manager Account](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7.md#03)
- [Additional Information](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7.md#04)

> [!NOTE]
> This walkthrough contains a series of steps in which you log in to your FTP site using an IIS Manager account. These steps should only be followed on the server itself using the loopback address or over SSL from a remote server. If you prefer to use a separate user account instead of an IIS 7 Manager account, create the appropriate folders and set the correct permissions for that user account when necessary.

<a id="01"></a>

## Prerequisites

You must install the following items to complete the procedures in this article:

1. IIS 7 must be installed on your that is running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2, and the Internet Information Services Manager must be installed.
2. The new FTP service. 

    - If you are using Windows Server 2008 R2, the new FTP service is installed as feature of the IIS role in Server Manager.
    - If you are using Windows Server 2008 you can download and install the FTP service from the [https://www.iis.net/](https://www.iis.net/) web site using one of the following links: 

        - [FTP 7.5 for IIS 7.0 (x64)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=143197)
        - [FTP 7.5 for IIS 7.0 (x86)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=143196)

The "Network Service" account is used by the COM process that handles authentication extensibility; therefore, you must grant the account specific permissions to certain folders to enable this form of authentication. To grant the "Network Service" account "read" permissions to the IIS "config" folder:

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Type the following command: 

    [!code-console[Main](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7/samples/sample1.cmd)]
3. Close the command prompt.

Create a root folder for FTP publishing:

1. Create a folder at `%SystemDrive%\inetpub\ftproot`.
2. Set the permissions to allow access for the COM process that handles authentication extensibility: 

    - Open a command prompt.
    - Type the following command: 

        [!code-console[Main](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7/samples/sample2.cmd)]
    - Close the command prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> The settings listed in this walkthrough specify `%SystemDrive%\inetpub\ftproot` as the path to your FTP site. You are not required to use this path; however, if you change the location for your site you will have to change the site-related paths that are used throughout this walkthrough.

## Configuring the IIS 7 Management Service

IIS 7 offers an optional management service that allows remote administration using non-Windows accounts. The steps in this section lead you through the steps to install and configure this service.

> [!NOTE]
> The IIS 7 Management Service must be installed in order to use IIS 7 Manager Authentication with FTP, but the service does not need to be started.

### Step 1: Install the IIS Management Service

In this first step, you install the IIS 7 management service.

1. Click **Server Manager** in the Windows Start menu.  
    [![](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image3.png)](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image1.png)
2. Click **Roles** in the tree view, locate the Web Server role and click **Add Role Services**.

## Creating a New FTP Site and Configuring an IIS 7 Manager Account

This section of the document walks you through the steps required to create a new FTP site from scratch and then configure the site to use the IIS 7 manager account that you created in the previous section.

### Step 1: Use the FTP Site Wizard to Create an FTP Site

In this first step, you create a new FTP site that can only be opened by the local administrator account.

1. Go to the IIS 7 Manager. In the **Connections** pane, click the **Sites** node in the tree.
2. Right-click the **Sites** node in the tree and click **Add FTP Site**, or click **Add FTP Site** in the **Actions** pane.  
    [![](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image3.jpg)](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image1.jpg)
3. When the **Add FTP Site** wizard appears: 

    - Enter "My New FTP Site" in the **FTP site name** box, then navigate to the `%SystemDrive%\inetpub\ftproot` folder that you created in the Prerequisites section.
	
	    > [!NOTE]
        > If you choose to type in the path to your content folder, you can use environment variables in your paths; for example: `%SystemDrive%\inetpub\ftproot`
    - Click **Next**.

    [![](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image7.jpg)](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image5.jpg)
4. On the next page of the wizard: 

    - Choose an IP address for your FTP site from the **IP Address** drop-down, or choose to accept the default selection of "All Unassigned." Because you will be using an IIS 7 manager account later in this walk-through, make sure that you restrict access to the server -- enter the local loopback IP address for your computer by typing "127.0.0.1" in the **IP Address** box.
    - You would normally enter the TCP/IP port for the FTP site in the **Port** box. For this walk-through, choose to accept the default port of 21.
    - For this walk- through, you will not use a host name, so make sure that the **Virtual Host** box is blank.
    - Make sure that the **SSL** **Certificate** drop-down is set to "Not Selected" and that the **Require SSL** option is not selected.
    - Click **Next**.

    [![](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image12.jpg)](configure-ftp-with-iis-manager-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image11.jpg)
5. On the next page of the wizard: 

    - In **Authentication** settings, select **Basic**.
    - In **Authorization** settings, choose "Specified users" from the **Allow access to** drop-down. Type "administrator" in the box, and select both **Read** and **Write** in **Permissions** options.
    - Click **Finish**.
