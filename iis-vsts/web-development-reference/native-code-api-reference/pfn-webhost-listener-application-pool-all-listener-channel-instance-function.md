# PFN_WEBHOST_LISTENER_APPLICATION_POOL_CAN_OPEN_NEW_LISTENER_CHANNEL_INSTANCE Function
Notifies the listener adapter that it is possible to launch other instances of this listener channel.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef VOID(* PFN_WEBHOST_LISTENER_APPLICATION_POOL_CAN_OPEN_NEW_LISTENER_CHANNEL_INSTANCE)(  
   IN VOID* pContext,  
   IN LPCWSTR AppPoolId,  
   IN DWORD ListenerChannelId  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `pContext`  
 [IN] A pointer to a `VOID` context that the listener adapter passed to [WebhostRegisterProtocol](../../web-development-reference\native-code-api-reference/webhostregisterprotocol-function.md).  
  
 `AppPoolId`  
 [IN] A pointer to a string that contains the application pool to which the listener adapter belongs.  
  
 `ListenerChannelId`  
 [IN] A `DWORD` that contains the listener channel ID.  
  
## Return Value  
 `VOID`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The listener adapter should call the [WebhostOpenListenerChannelInstance](../../web-development-reference\native-code-api-reference/webhostopenlistenerchannelinstance-function.md) function to open the initial listener channel when it receives the first request. The listener adapter should not call `WebhostOpenListenerChannelInstance` again until it is notified through this function.  
  
 This notification can be called whenever a new instance of a listener channel can be connected to a worker process. The following are some of the situations in which this notification may occur:  
  
-   A Web garden contains processes that can either be launched or that are not currently running the processing code for this listener channel.  
  
-   A worker process has idled out and a new one can be launched.  
  
-   A non-overlap recycle process has occurred and a new worker process can be launched.  
  
-   A worker process has terminated unexpectedly and a new one can be launched.  
  
-   The application domain the listener channel was connected to has idled out.  
  
-   The application domain was shut down (for any reason); therefore, the listener channel was stopped and can now be restarted.  
  
 The Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) calls this function asynchronously and does not wait for the completion of the notification.
