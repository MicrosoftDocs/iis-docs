SQL Server 2005
====================
by [Walter Oliver](https://github.com/walterov)

## Introduction

SQL Server 2005 is an ideal database platform for use in shared and dedicated Web hosting environments. Of the various SQL Server editions, only **SQL Server Express should never be used in Shared Hosting scenarios**, this edition was meant for application development environments only; see [SQL Server Express and Hosting](https://blogs.msdn.com/sqlexpress/archive/2008/02/22/sql-server-express-and-hosting.aspx "SQL Server Express and Hosting") for details.

The [SQL Server 2005 Deployment Guidance for Web Hosting Environments](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/bestpractice/sql2005dgwhe.mspx "SQL 2005 Guide") provides best practices for configuring SQL Server 2005 to optimize security, tenant isolation, and the performance of your hosted SQL Server 2005 deployment. Sample scripts for provisioning users and databases for use in shared hosting are included.
