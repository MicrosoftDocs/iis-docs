## Properties

|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`MaximumErrorResponseLength`|A read/write `sint32` value that specifies the maximum allowed length, in kilobytes, of an error response. The default is 64.|  
|`MaximumResponseHeadersLength`|A read/write `sint32` value that specifies the maximum allowed length of the response headers. The default is 64.<br /><br /> The length is measured in kilobytes (1024 bytes) and it includes the response status line and the response headers, as well as all extra control characters received as part of the HTTP protocol. A value of -1 means no limit is imposed on the response headers; a value of 0 means that all requests will fail.|  
|`MaximumUnauthorizedUploadLength`|A read/write `sint32` value that specifies the maximum length, in bytes, of an upload in response to an unauthorized error code. The default is â€“1, which indicates that no size limit will be imposed on the upload.|  
|`UseUnsafeHeaderParsing`|A read/write `boolean` value. `true` if validation errors that occur during HTTP parsing are ignored; otherwise, `false`. The default is `false`.|
