How to Deploy Applications on the Microsoft Web Platform for PHP
====================
by Tali Smith

There are a couple of steps you can take to optimize deployment of your applications on the Microsoft Web Platform, including:

- [Translate .htaccess Files to Web.config Files](translate-htaccess-content-to-iis-webconfig.md). This article shows how to use the IIS web.config file for the functions performed by the Apache .htaccess functions.
- [Provide URL Rewriting Functionality](provide-url-rewriting-functionality.md). The URL Rewrite Module provides flexible rules-based rewrite engine that can be used to perform broad spectrum of URL manipulation tasks.

You can use the [Web Platform Installer (Web PI)](https://www.microsoft.com/web/Downloads/platform.aspx) to easily download a variety of applications, including DasBlog (an ASP.NET blogging application), AtomSite (an online publishing platform), and Moodle (a learning management system).

You can also visit the [Windows Web App Gallery](https://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/) for one-click installation of applications such as Gallery (Web-based photo gallery), Umbraco (content management system), mojoPortal (content management system and web application framework for ASP.NET 3.5), DotNetNuke (content management system and application development framework), and Kentico CMS for ASP.NET (content management system).

[Using FastCGI to Host PHP Applications on IIS 7.0 and Above](using-fastcgi-to-host-php-applications-on-iis.md) and [Using FastCGI to Host PHP Applications on IIS 6.0](using-fastcgi-to-host-php-applications-on-iis-60.md) provide instructions for setting up FastCGI and PHP to host applications; this information is also detailed in a number of articles in [Install the Microsoft Web Platform](../install-and-configure-php-on-iis/index.md).

For guidance in manually deploying specific applications, see:

- Install [Zen Cart](install-zen-cart-on-iis.md) (open-source online store management system)
- Install [osCommerce](install-oscommerce-on-iis.md) (open-source based, online shopping and e-commerce solution)
- Install [Drupal](install-drupal-on-iis.md) (open-source content management system)
- Install [Joomla](install-joomla-on-iis.md) (open-source content management system)
- Install [WordPress](install-wordpress-on-iis.md) (a blogging package)
