# Installing PHP on Windows Vista with FastCGI

by [Ruslan Yakushev](https://github.com/ruslany)

## FastCGI support in Windows Vista

Microsoft IIS 7.0 for Windows Vista SP1 now includes a built-in FastCGI component. To get detailed information on how to use FastCGI component to host PHP applications on Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista SP1 refer to this [article](../install-and-configure-php-applications-on-iis/using-fastcgi-to-host-php-applications-on-iis.md "PHP on IIS7").

[![](installing-php-on-windows-vista-with-fastcgi/_static/image2.gif)](installing-php-on-windows-vista-with-fastcgi/_static/image1.gif) IIS7.0 included in Windows Vista (not SP1) does not include FastCGI component. In order to get FastCGI support on IIS7.0 in Windows Vista it is necessary to upgrade to Vista SP1.
