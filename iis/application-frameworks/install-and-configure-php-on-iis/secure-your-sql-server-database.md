Secure Your SQL Server Database
====================
by Tali Smith

## Introduction

If you use Microsoft® SQL Server® as your database, you must create and implement an effective security plan. There is a wealth of information about how to secure a SQL Server database; this article touches on a few areas of particular interest to Web hosters and provides links for further information.

Securing SQL Server can be viewed as a series of steps involving four areas: the platform, authentication, objects (including data), and applications that access the system.

## Platform and Network Security

The platform for SQL Server includes the physical hardware and networking systems connecting clients to the database servers and the binary files that are used to process database requests.

### Physical Security

Best practices for physical security strictly limit access to the physical server and hardware components. For example, use locked rooms with restricted access for the database server hardware and networking devices. In addition, limit access to backup media by storing it at a secure off-site location.

Implementing physical network security starts with keeping unauthorized users off the network. The following table contains more information about networking security information.

### System Security

Operating system service packs and upgrades include important security enhancements. Apply all updates and upgrades to the operating system after you test them with the database applications.

Firewalls also provide effective ways to implement security. Logically, a firewall is a separator or restrictor of network traffic, which can be configured to enforce your organization's data security policy. If you use a firewall, you increase security at the operating system level by providing a chokepoint where your security measures can be focused.

The following table contains more information about how to use a firewall with SQL Server.

Surface-area reduction is a security measure that involves stopping or disabling unused components. Surface-area reduction helps improve security by providing fewer avenues for potential attacks on a system. The key to limiting the surface area of SQL Server includes running required services that have "least privilege" by granting services and users only the appropriate rights.

The following table contains more information about services and system access.

| **For information about** | **See** |

| Local administration rights | [Granting Local Administrative Rights](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174494.aspx) |

For Internet Information Services (IIS), additional steps are required to help secure the surface of the platform.

### SQL Server Operating System Files Security

SQL Server uses operating system files for operation and data storage. Best practices for file security require that you restrict access to these files.

The following table contains information about these files.

| **For information about** | **See** |
| --- | --- |
| SQL Server program files | [File Locations for Default and Named Instances of SQL Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms143547.aspx) |
| Database file security | [Securing Data and Log Files](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189128.aspx) |
| Analysis Services file security | [Securing Program Files, Common Components, and Data Files](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174838.aspx) |

SQL Server service packs and upgrades provide enhanced security. To determine the latest available service pack available for SQL Server, see the [SQL Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=31629) Web site.

You can use the following script to determine the service pack installed on the system.

## Principals and Database Object Security

Principals are the individuals, groups, and processes granted access to SQL Server. "Securables" are the server, database, and objects the database contains. Each has a set of permissions that can be configured to help reduce the SQL Server surface area.

The following table contains information about principals and securables.

| Server and database objects security | [Securable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms190401.aspx) |
| The SQL Server security hierarchy | [Permissions Hierarchy (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191465.aspx) |

For more information about database and application security, see [Identity and Access Control (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb510418.aspx).

### Encryption and Certificates

Encryption does not solve access control problems. However, encryption enhances security by limiting data loss even in the rare occurrence that access controls are bypassed. For example, if the database host computer is misconfigured and a malicious user obtains sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, that stolen information might be useless if it is encrypted.

The following table contains more information about encryption in SQL Server.

Certificates are software "keys" shared between two servers that enable secure communications by way of strong authentication. You can create and use certificates in SQL Server to enhance object and connection security.

The following table contains information about how to use certificates with SQL Server.
