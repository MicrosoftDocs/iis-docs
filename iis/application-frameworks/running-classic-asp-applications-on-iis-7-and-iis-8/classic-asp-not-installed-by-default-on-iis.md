# Classic ASP Not Installed by Default on IIS 7.0 and above

by [Robert McMurray](https://github.com/rmcmurray)

One of the challenges of running IIS on your own server vs. running it [in the cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/) is that you need to install the components you need manually, and it can sometimes be tricky figuring out what needs to be installed to get the functionality you need. For example, in IIS, the classic version of ASP is not installed by default. Because of this, you might see HTTP 404 errors when you try to browse to an ASP page on your server, or you might see the source code for your ASP page displayed in your browser window. Both of these error conditions are created when configuration settings that are used to define the environment for classic ASP are not installed.

To support and configure ASP applications on your Web server, you must install the ASP module. To install the ASP module on IIS, use the following steps for your version of Windows.

## Installing Classic ASP on Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2

1. On the taskbar, click **Server Manager**.
2. In **Server Manager**, click the **Manage** menu, and then click **Add Roles and Features**.
3. In the **Add Roles and Features** wizard, click **Next**. Select the installation type and click **Next**. Select the destination server and click **Next**.
4. On the **Server Roles** page, expand **Web Server (IIS)**, expand **Web Server**, and then expand **Application Development**.
