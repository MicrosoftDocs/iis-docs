by [Keith Newman and Robert McMurray](https://github.com/rmcmurray)

This document contains an overview of the **Build a PHP website on IIS** scenario. It also contains links to additional information and community resources related to the scenario.

## Scenario Description

This scenario shows how to plan and configure a PHP website on an IIS 8 webserver. It is divided into two phases: a plan and design phase, and an install and configure phase. In the plan and design phase, you are provided the information needed to make informed decisions about web server installation, PHP settings, and basic application security. In the install and configure phase, you are guided through the procedures required to install IIS, add a PHP application, and configure IIS and PHP.

This scenario does not cover how to write a PHP application.
