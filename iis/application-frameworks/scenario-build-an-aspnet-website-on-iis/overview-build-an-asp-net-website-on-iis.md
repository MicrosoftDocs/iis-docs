by [Keith Newman and Robert McMurray](https://github.com/rmcmurray)

This document contains an overview of the **Build an ASP.NET Website on IIS** scenario. It also contains links to additional information and community resources related to the scenario.

## Scenario Description

This scenario shows how to plan and configure an ASP.NET website on an IIS 8 webserver. It is divided into two phases: a plan and design phase, and an install and configure phase. In the plan and design phase, you are provided the information needed to make informed decisions about web server installation, ASP.NET settings, data source settings, and basic application security. In the install and configure phase, you are guided through the procedures required to install IIS, add an ASP.NET application, and configure IIS.

This scenario does not cover how to write an ASP.NET application.
