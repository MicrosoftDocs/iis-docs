Configuration Redirection &lt;configurationRedirection&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<configurationRedirection>` element lets you to share configuration files from a centralized location to multiple Internet Information Services (IIS) 7 server computers in a Web farm. This allows you to configure one IIS 7 server in your Web farm and to share the resulting configuration settings across all IIS 7 servers in the Web farm. This element also lets you store configuration settings on a UNC server that all Web server computers in the Web farm can access.

#### Changes in IIS 7.5

In IIS 7.5, two new attributes have been added that control whether IIS will use change notifications or UNC polling to determine if the configuration files have changed. These attributes are:

- `enableUncPolling`: 

    - When set to **true**, IIS will periodically check the UNC share to test if the configuration files have been updated.
    - When set to **false**, change notifications will continue be used as they were in IIS 7.0.
- `pollingPeriod`: Specifies the time interval between UNC checks that IIS will use.

## Configuration

The `<configurationRedirection>` element is configured in the Redirection.config file.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Optional Boolean attribute.<br><br>Specifies whether configuration redirection is enabled or disabled on the Web server.<br><br>The default value is `false`. |
| `enableUncPolling` | Optional Boolean attribute.<br><br>**true** if UNC polling should be used to check if the configuration files have been updated; otherwise, **false** if change notifications should be used. Note: The time interval between checks is configured by the `pollingPeriod` attribute.<br><br>**Note:** This attribute was added in IIS 7.5.<br><br>The default value is `false`. |
| `password` | Optional string attribute.<br><br>Specifies the password that you need to authenticate the user name to access the location for configuration file storage. This is a case sensitive string.<br><br>**Note:** To avoid storing unencrypted password strings in configuration files, always use AppCmd.exe or the IIS Manager to enter passwords. If you use these management tools, the password strings will be encrypted automatically before they are written to the XML configuration files. This provides better password security than storing unencrypted passwords. |
| `path` | Optional string attribute.<br><br>Specifies the location from which to read configuration files and encryption keys. This can be a network path or a folder on the local computer.<br><br>There is no default value. |
| `pollingPeriod` | Optional timeSpan attribute.<br><br>Specifies the time interval between checks that IIS will use to check if the configuration files have been updated. Note: This only applies when the `enableUncPolling` attribute is set to **true**.<br><br>**Note:** This attribute was added in IIS 7.5.<br><br>The default value is `00:03:00` (three minutes.) |
| `userName` | Optional string attribute.<br><br>Specifies the user name to access the location for configuration file storage.<br><br>There is no default value. |

## Sample Code

The following examples enable shared configuration by using the exported configuration files that are shared at \\ServerName\ShareName, and by using a user name of "MyUser" with a password of "P@ssw0rd" to access the share.
