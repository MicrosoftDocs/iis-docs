Modules &lt;modules&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<modules>` element specifies the features that are available in IIS Manager when a user is connected to a site or an application. The `<modules>` element works with the `<moduleProviders>` element in the following way:

- The `<moduleProviders>` element specifies the list of module providers for IIS Manager.
- The `<modules>` element specifies the list of modules that will appear as features when a user connects to a site or an application to IIS Manager.

You can configure which modules will be available for individual Web sites using `<location>` tags, so that each Web site or application can be customized to suit your needs. For example, you could configure the site-level management for a Web site to allow only a small subset of features, and configure a child application for a broader set of features.

> [!NOTE]
> This collection of modules is specific to IIS Manager and should not be confused with the [&lt;system.webServer modules&gt;](../system.webserver/modules/index.md) collection, which defines modules that affect HTTP request processing.

> [!NOTE]
> The settings in the `<modules>` element can only be configured in the Administration.config file.

## Configuration

### Attributes

### Child Elements

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`add`](add.md) | Optional element. Adds a module to the collection of modules for IIS Manager. |

### Configuration Sample

The following sample configuration excerpt from the Administration.config file adds a managed module provider named ContosoProvider to the end of the `<modules>` collection.

> This sample configuration excerpt has been shortened for easier reading.

[!code-xml[Main](index/samples/sample1.xml)]

The following sample configuration excerpt from the Administration.config file specifies custom `<modules>` elements for the Default Web Site and a child application by defining unique `<location>` elements that clear the default module lists and define the specific modules that will be respectively enabled for each location. When a remote administration connects to either location, IIS Manager will only display those features that are represented by the modules that are listed in each `<location>` element.
