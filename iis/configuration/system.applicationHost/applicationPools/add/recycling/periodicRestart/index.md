# Periodic Restart Settings for Application Pool Recycling &lt;periodicRestart&gt;

<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<periodicRestart>` element contains configuration settings that allow you to control when an application pool is recycled. You can specify that Internet Information Services (IIS) 7 recycle the application pool after a time interval (in minutes) or at a specific time each day. You can also configure IIS to base the recycle on the amount of virtual memory or physical memory that the worker process in the application pool is using or configure IIS to recycle the application pool after the worker process has processed a specific number of requests.

## Configuration

The `<periodicRestart>` element is configurable at the server level in the ApplicationHost.config file.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `memory` | Optional uint attribute.<br><br>Specifies the amount of virtual memory (in kilobytes) that a worker process can use before the worker process is recycled.<br><br>The default value is `0`, which disables the attribute. |
| `privateMemory` | Optional uint attribute.<br><br>Specifies the amount of private memory (in kilobytes) that a worker process can use before the worker process recycles.<br><br>The default value is `0`, which disables the attribute. |
| `requests` | Optional uint attribute.<br><br>Specifies that the worker process should be recycled after it processes a specific number of requests.<br><br>The default value is `0`, which disables the attribute. |
| `time` | Optional timeSpan attribute.<br><br>Specifies that the worker process should be recycled after a specified amount of time has elapsed.<br><br>The default value is `29:00:00` (29 hours). |

### Child Elements

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`schedule`](schedule/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Specifies the scheduling of periodic restarts of application pools. |

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration sample uses the application pool `<add>` element to create a new application pool named Contoso. The `<recycling>` element configures logging for application pool restarts, the `<periodicRestart>` element configures when the application pool restarts, and the `<processModel>` element configures the **shutdownTimeLimit** and **startupTimeLimit** attributes for shutting down and starting the worker processes in the application pool for 30 seconds each. If these time limits are exceeded, IIS terminates the worker process.

## Sample Code

The following code examples add an application pool named Contoso to your IIS 7 server, then set the application pool to daily recycle at 3:00 A.M.

### AppCmd.exe

[!code-console[Main](index/samples/sample2.cmd)]

You can also use the following syntax:

[!code-console[Main](index/samples/sample3.cmd)]

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
