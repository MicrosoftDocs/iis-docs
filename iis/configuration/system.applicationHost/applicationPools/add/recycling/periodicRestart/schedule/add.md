## Configuration

You configure the `<add>` element at the server level in the ApplicationHost.config file.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Value` | Required timeSpan attribute. Specifies a unique local time, on a 24-hour clock, to begin a scheduled periodic restart of an application pool. |

### Child Elements

None.

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration sample uses the application pool `<add>` element to create a new application pool named Contoso. The `<recycling>` element configures logging for application pool restarts, the `<periodicRestart>` element configures when the application pool restarts, and the `<processModel>` element configures the **shutdownTimeLimit** and **startupTimeLimit** attributes for shutting down and starting the worker processes in the application pool for 30 seconds each. If these time limits are exceeded, IIS terminates the worker process.

## Sample Code

The following code examples add an application pool named Contoso to your IIS 7 server, then set the application pool to daily recycle at 3:00 A.M.

### AppCmd.exe

[!code-console[Main](add/samples/sample2.cmd)]

You can also use the following syntax:

[!code-console[Main](add/samples/sample3.cmd)]

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
