## Overview

The `<system.applicationHost>` element contains global configuration settings that are used by the Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) in Internet Information Services (IIS) 7. This element defines many of the server-level configuration settings in the IIS 7 ApplicationHost.config file.

Of significant importance, the `<system.applicationHost>` element contains the configuration settings for the [&lt;applicationPools&gt;](applicationpools/index.md) and [&lt;sites&gt;](sites/index.md) collections, which respectively define the collection of application pools and Web sites on an IIS 7 server.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike the settings that are found in [&lt;system.webServer&gt;](../system.webserver/index.md), settings in the `<system.applicationHost>` element cannot be delegated.
