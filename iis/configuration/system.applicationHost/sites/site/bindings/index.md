Bindings &lt;bindings&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<bindings>` element configures binding information for an IIS 7 or later Web site. It can also define the default bindings for all sites on the Web server if it is included in the `<siteDefaults>` element.

This element can contain a collection of `<binding>` elements. Each element in the collection defines a separate set of binding information that a request can use to contact the Web site. For example, if your site requires users to contact it using both the HTTP protocol and the HTTPS protocol, you must define a binding for each protocol.

You can also use `<clear />` element in the `<bindings>` element to override binding defaults inherited from the server level `<siteDefaults>` element.

## Configuration

You can add a `<bindings>` element for each site in the ApplicationHost.config file, which can contain a collection of individual `<binding>` elements that define the individual protocol bindings for the site. Each site will need at least one HTTP or HTTPS binding to be viewable over the Internet.

You can also use `<clear />` element in the `<bindings>` element to override binding defaults inherited from the server level `<siteDefaults>` element.

### Attributes

None.

### Child Elements

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`binding`](binding.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Configures a binding in the parent site. |
| `clear` | Optional element.<br><br>Clears references to default settings that are inherited from the parent level of the configuration. |

### Configuration Sample

The following example defines a site named Contoso with two bindings. The first binding is for a hostname of &quot;www.contoso.com&quot; on port 80 for the IP address of 192.168.0.1, and the second binding is for an HTTPS binding for all IP addresses over port 443.

## Sample Code

The following examples configure a site named Contoso with a hostname of &quot;www.contoso.com&quot; on port 80 for the IP address of 192.168.0.1, and an HTTPS binding for all IP addresses over port 443.

### AppCmd.exe

Or you can use:

[!code-console[Main](index/samples/sample3.cmd)]

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
