Default FTP over SSL Settings &lt;ssl&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<ssl>` element specifies the FTP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) settings for the FTP service; FTP over SSL was first introduced for IIS 7 in FTP 7.0.

Unlike using HTTP over SSL, which requires a separate port and connection for secure (HTTPS) communication, secure FTP communication occurs on the same port as non-secure communication. FTP 7 supports two different forms of FTP over SSL:

- **Explicit FTPS**: By default, FTP sites and clients use port 21 for the control channel, and the server and client will negotiate secondary ports for data channel connections. In a typical FTP request, an FTP client client will connect to an FTP site over the control channel, and then the client can negotiate SSL/TLS with the server for either the control channel or the data channel. When you are using FTP 7, you are using Explicit SSL if you enable FTPS and you assign the FTP site to any port other than port 990.
- **Implicit FTPS**: Implicit FTPS is an older form of FTP over SSL that is still supported by FTP 7. With Implicit FTPS, an SSL handshake must be negotiated before any FTP commands can be sent by the client. In addition, even though Explicit FTPS allows the client to arbitrarily decide whether to use SSL, Implicit FTPS requires that the entire FTP session must be encrypted. When you are using FTP 7, you are using Implicit SSL if you enable FTPS and you assign the FTP site to port 990.

Depending on the security options that you configure in the `controlChannelPolicy` and `dataChannelPolicy` attributes, an FTP client may switch between secure and non-secure multiple times in a single Explicit FTPS session. There are several ways that this might be implemented depending on your business needs:

| controlChannelPolicy | dataChannelPolicy | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SslAllow` | `SslAllow` | This configuration allows the client to decide whether any part of the FTP session should be encrypted. |
| `SslRequireCredentialsOnly` | `SslAllow` | This configuration protects your FTP client credentials from electronic eavesdropping, and allows the client to decide whether data transfers should be encrypted. |
| `SslRequireCredentialsOnly` | `SslRequire` | This configuration requires that the client's credentials must be secure, and then allows the client to decide whether FTP commands should be encrypted. However, all data transfers must be encrypted. |
| `SslRequire` | `SslRequire` | This configuration is the most secure - the client must negotiate SSL by using the FTPS-related commands before other FTP commands are allowed, and all data transfers must be encrypted. |

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The `<ssl>` element was not modified in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<ssl>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<ssl>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<ssl>` element of the `<security>` element ships as a feature of IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<ssl>` element of the `<security>` element was introduced in FTP 7.0, which was a separate download for IIS 7.0. |
| IIS 6.0 | The FTP service in IIS 6.0 did not support FTP over SSL. |

> [!NOTE]
> The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the modules from the following URL:

> [https://www.iis.net/expand/FTP](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp)


With Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5, so downloading the FTP service is no longer necessary.

    [![](ssl/_static/image12.png)](ssl/_static/image11.png)
5. Under **SSL Policy**, select one of the following options: 

    - **Allow SSL connections**: Allows the FTP server to support both non-SSL and SSL connections with a client.
    - **Require SSL connections**: Requires SSL encryption for communication between the FTP server and a client.
    - **Custom**: Enables you to configure a different SSL encryption policy for the control channel and the data channel. If you choose this option, click the **Advanced...** button. When the **Advanced SSL Policy** dialog box opens, select the following options: 

        - Under **Control Channel** select one of the following options for SSL encryption over the control channel: 

            - **Allow**: Specifies that SSL is allowed for the control channel; an FTP client may use SSL for the control channel, but it is not required.
            - **Require**: Specifies that SSL is required for the control channel; an FTP client may not switch to a non-secure mode of communication for the control channel.
            - **Require only for credentials**: Specifies that only the user credentials have to be sent over SSL session; an FTP client must use SSL for their user name and password, but the client is not required to use SSL for the control channel after they have logged in.
        - Under **Data Channel**, select one of the following options for SSL encryption over the data channel: 

            - **Allow**: SSL is allowed for the data channel; an FTP client may use SSL for the data channel, but it is not required.
            - **Require**: SSL is required for the data channel; an FTP client may not switch to a non-secure mode of communication for the data channel.
            - **Deny**: SSL is denied for the data channel; an FTP client may not use SSL for the data channel.
        - Click **OK** to close the **Advanced SSL Policy** dialog box.
6. In the **Actions** pane, click **Apply**.
