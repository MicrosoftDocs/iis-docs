FTP Firewall Support &lt;firewallSupport&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<system.ftpServer/firewallSupport>` element is used to configure the port range that the FTP service will use for data channel activity when you use the FTP PASV command to negotiate passive connections, which contains IP address and port of the server.

When passive connections are negotiated using the FTP PASV command, the FTP server sends a response which contains IP address and port of the server. By specifying the `lowDataChannelPort` and `highDataChannelPort` attributes, you can direct FTP clients to communicate with your firewall, which should route the client traffic to your FTP server.

The valid range for TCP/IP ports is 1025 through 65535. (Ports from 1 through 1024 are reserved for use by system services.) You can enter a special port range of "0-0" to configure the FTP server to use the Windows TCP/IP ephemeral port range. In early versions of Windows, the TCP/IP ephemeral port range was set to use ports 1025 through 5000. Starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the TCP/IP ephemeral port range has been changed to 49152 through 65535. For more information about the ephemeral port range, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

> [929851: The default dynamic port range for TCP/IP has changed in Windows Vista and in Windows Server 2008](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929851/)


> [!NOTE]
> You can use the [`<ftpServer/firewallSupport>`](../system.applicationhost/sites/site/ftpserver/firewallsupport.md) to configure the per-site external IP address for your firewall; this allows you to route the firewall traffic for each site through a different firewall.

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The `<firewallSupport>` element was not modified in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<firewallSupport>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<firewallSupport>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<firewallSupport>` element of the `<system.ftpServer>` element ships as a feature of IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<firewallSupport>` element of the `<system.ftpServer>` element was introduced in FTP 7.0, which was a separate download for IIS 7.0. |
| IIS 6.0 | The `<firewallSupport>` element replaces the IIS 6.0 **MSFTPSVC/PassivePortRange** metabase property. |

> [!NOTE]
> The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the modules from the following URL:

> [https://www.iis.net/expand/FTP](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp)


With Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5, so downloading the FTP service is no longer necessary.

## Configuration

The `<firewallSupport>` element is configured at the global level in ApplicationHost.config.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `lowDataChannelPort` | Optional int attribute.<br><br>Specifies the lowest port for data channel activity for passive data connections.<br><br>The default value is `0`. |
| `highDataChannelPort` | Optional int attribute.<br><br>Specifies the lowest port for data channel activity for passive data connections.<br><br>The default value is `0`. |

### Child Elements

None.

### Configuration Sample

The following sample illustrates several configuration settings in the global `<system.ftpServer>` element for a server. More specifically, the settings in this example demonstrate how to:

- Enable FTP credential caching and specify a time-out of 10 minutes (600 seconds.)
- Configure the low port as 5000 and the high port as 6000 for data channel communications.
- Enable logging and specify that log files will be kept per-site, and that log files will be rotated daily by UTC time.
- Specify a custom FTP provider and specify a custom parameter for that provider.
- Specify global IP restrictions that allow FTP access from local host and deny access to the 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255 block of IP addresses.
- Configure request filtering with the following options: 

    - Block FTP access to the \_vti\_bin virtual directory, which is used with the FrontPage Server Extensions.
    - Block several file types that are associated with executables.
    - Specify 100MB as the maximum file size.
- Add a global authorization rule that allows access for the administrators group.
- Specify that domain name syntax can be used for FTP virtual host names.

## Sample Code

The following examples configure the FTP service to use the port range of 5000 to 6000 for data channel activity when passive connections are used.

### AppCmd.exe

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
