FTP Authorization &lt;authorization&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<authorization>` element allows you to configure the user accounts that can access your site or application. Use authorization in combination with authentication to secure access to content on your server. Authentication confirms the identity of a user, while authorization determines what resources users can or cannot access.

IIS defines two types of authorization rules, Allow rules and Deny rules:

- Allow rules let you define the user accounts or user groups that can access a site, an application, or all the sites on a server.
- Deny rules let you define the user accounts or user groups that cannot access a site, an application, or all the sites on a server.

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The `<authorization>` element was not modified in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<authorization>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<authorization>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<authorization>` element of the `<system.ftpServer/security>` element ships as a feature of IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<authorization>` element of the `<system.ftpServer/security>` element was introduced in FTP 7.0, which was a separate download for IIS 7.0. |
| IIS 6.0 | N/A |

> [!NOTE]
> The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the modules from the following URL:
> 
> [https://www.iis.net/expand/FTP](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp)


With Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5, so downloading the FTP service is no longer necessary.

## Configuration

You can configure the `<authorization>` element at the site or URL level in the ApplicationHost.config file. You can set default authorization rules for the entire server by configuring authorization rules at the server level. You can remove, clear, or override these rules by configuring more specific rules for your sites or URLs.

### Attributes

None.

### Child Elements

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`add`](add.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Adds an authorization rule to the collection of authorization rules. |
| `remove` | Optional element. <br><br>Removes a reference to an authorization rule to the collection of authorization rules. |
| `clear` | Optional element.<br><br>Removes all references to authorization rules from the collection of authorization rules. |

### Configuration Sample

The following sample illustrates several security-related configuration settings in the `<system.ftpServer>` element for an FTP site. More specifically, the `<location>` settings in this example demonstrate how to:

- Specify an FTP authorization rule for read and write access for the administrators group.
- Specify FTP request filtering options that deny \*.exe, \*.bat, and \*.cmd files.
- Specify FTP request limits for a maximum content length of 1000000 bytes and a maximum URL length of 1024 bytes.
- Block FTP access to the \_vti\_bin virtual directory, which is used with the FrontPage Server Extensions.
- Specify FTP IP filtering options that allow access from 127.0.0.1 and deny access from the 169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0 range of IP addresses.

## Sample Code

The following examples add two FTP authorization rules for the Default Web Site. The first rule allows read and write access for the administrators group, and the second rule denies read and write access for the guest account.

### AppCmd.exe

[!code-console[Main](index/samples/sample2.cmd)]

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
