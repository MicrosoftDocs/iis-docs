Adding FTP IP Security &lt;add&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<add>` element of the `<ipSecurity>` collection defines a unique IP security restriction. Each restriction can be based on the IP version 4 address, a range of IP version 4 addresses, or a DNS domain name.

<a id="002"></a>
## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The `<add>` element was not modified in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<add>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<add>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<add>` element of the `<ipSecurity>` element ships as a feature of IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<add>` element of the `<ipSecurity>` element was introduced in FTP 7.0, which was a separate download for IIS 7.0. |
| IIS 6.0 | The `<system.ftpServer>` element and its child elements replace the IIS 6.0 FTP settings that were located in the **LM/MSFTPSVC** metabase path. |

> [!NOTE]
> The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the modules from the following URL:
> 
> [https://www.iis.net/expand/FTP](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp)


With Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5, so downloading the FTP service is no longer necessary.

## Configuration

The `<add>` element is configured at the site or URL level.

Rules are processed from top to bottom, in the order they appear in the list. The **allowunlisted** attribute is processed last. Best practice for Internet Protocol security (IPsec) restrictions is to list Deny rules first. You cannot clear the **allowunlisted** attribute if it is set to **false**.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `allowed` | Optional **Boolean** attribute.<br><br>Specifies whether to allow access to the address space.<br><br>The default value is `false`. |
| `domainName` | Optional string attribute.<br><br>Specifies the domain name on which to impose a restriction rule. You can use an asterisk (\*) as a wildcard. |
| `ipAddress` | Optional string attribute.<br><br>Specifies the IP version 4 address on which to impose a restriction rule. |
| `subnetMask` | Optional string attribute.<br><br>Specifies the subnet mask with which to evaluate the IP address for this restriction rule. You can use a subnet mask to identify a range of IP addresses in an address space. The default value requires a direct match of the IP address being evaluated (effectively, a range of a single address).<br><br>The default value is `255.255.255.255`. |

### Child Elements

None.

### Configuration Sample

The following sample illustrates several security-related configuration settings in the `<system.ftpServer>` element for an FTP site. More specifically, the `<location>` settings in this example demonstrate how to:

- Specify an FTP authorization rule for read and write access for the administrators group.
- Specify FTP request filtering options that deny \*.exe, \*.bat, and \*.cmd files.
- Specify FTP request limits for a maximum content length of 1000000 bytes and a maximum URL length of 1024 bytes.
- Block FTP access to the \_vti\_bin virtual directory, which is used with the FrontPage Server Extensions.
- Specify FTP IP filtering options that allow access from 127.0.0.1 and deny access from the 169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0 range of IP addresses.

## Sample Code

The following examples configure FTP IP security to allow unlisted IP addresses, then specify IP restrictions that allow access from 127.0.0.1 and deny access from the 169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0 range of IP addresses.

### AppCmd.exe

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
