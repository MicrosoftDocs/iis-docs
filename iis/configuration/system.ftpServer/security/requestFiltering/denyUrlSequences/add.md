Adding FTP Deny URL Sequences &lt;add&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<add>` element of the `<denyUrlSequences>` collection specifies a unique sequence of characters to add to the collection of denied URL sequences for FTP 7.

> [!NOTE]
> When request filtering blocks an FTP request because of a denied URL sequence, FTP 7 will return an FTP error to the client and log the following FTP substatus that identifies the reason that the request was denied:

| FTP Substatus | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `9` | Denied URL sequence detected in the requested path. |

This substatus allows Web administrators to analyze their IIS logs and identify potential threats.

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The `<add>` element was not modified in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<add>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<add>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<add>` element of the `<denyUrlSequences>` element ships as a feature of IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<add>` element of the `<denyUrlSequences>` element was introduced in FTP 7.0, which was a separate download for IIS 7.0. |
| IIS 6.0 | The FTP service in IIS 6.0 did not support request filtering. |

> [!NOTE]
> The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the modules from the following URL:

> [https://www.iis.net/expand/FTP](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp)


With Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5, so downloading the FTP service is no longer necessary.

## Configuration

The `<add>` element of the `<denyUrlSequences>` collection is configured at the global, site or URL level.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sequence` | Required string attribute. Specifies sequences of characters in URLs that the FTP server should never process to help prevent URL-based attacks on the FTP server. |

### Child Elements

None.

### Configuration Sample

The following sample illustrates several security-related configuration settings in the `<system.ftpServer>` element for an FTP site. More specifically, the `<location>` settings in this example demonstrate how to:

- Specify an FTP authorization rule for read and write access for the administrators group.
- Specify FTP request filtering options that deny \*.exe, \*.bat, and \*.cmd files.
- Specify FTP request limits for a maximum content length of 1000000 bytes and a maximum URL length of 1024 bytes.
- Block FTP access to the \_vti\_bin virtual directory, which is used with the FrontPage Server Extensions.
- Specify FTP IP filtering options that allow access from 127.0.0.1 and deny access from the 169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0 range of IP addresses.

## Sample Code

The following examples will deny the URL sequence "bin" for FTP, which will prevent access to the "bin", "\_vti\_bin", or "cgi-bin" paths, and also prevent uploading files with a file name extension of ".bin."

### AppCmd.exe

[!code-console[Main](add/samples/sample2.cmd)]

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
