# FTP Request Limits &lt;requestLimits&gt;

The `<requestLimits>` element specifies limits on FTP requests that are processed by the FTP server. These limits include the maximum size of a request and the maximum length for a command sequence.

> [!NOTE]
> When request filtering blocks an FTP request because an FTP request exceeds the request limits, FTP 7 will return an FTP error to the client and log one of the following FTP substatuses that identifies the reason that the request was denied:
>
> | FTP Substatus | Description |
> | --- | --- |
> | `12` | Path is too long based on request filtering rules. |
> | `51` | Command filtering rules denied the access. |
>
> These substatuses allow FTP administrators to analyze their IIS logs and identify potential threats.

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The `<requestLimits>` element was not modified in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<requestLimits>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<requestLimits>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<requestLimits>` element of the `<requestFiltering>` element ships as a feature of IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<requestLimits>` element of the `<requestFiltering>` element was introduced in FTP 7.0, which was a separate download for IIS 7.0. |
| IIS 6.0 | The FTP service in IIS 6.0 did not support request filtering. |

> [!NOTE]
> The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the modules from the following URL:
>
> <https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp>

With Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5, so downloading the FTP service is no longer necessary.

## Configuration

The `<requestLimits>` element of the `<requestFiltering>` element is configured at the global, site or URL level.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `maxAllowedContentLength` | Optional int64 attribute.<br><br>Specifies the maximum length of content in a request, in bytes.<br><br>The default value is `0` (unlimited). |

### Configuration Sample

The following sample illustrates several security-related configuration settings in the `<system.ftpServer>` element for an FTP site. More specifically, the `<location>` settings in this example demonstrate how to:

- Specify an FTP authorization rule for read and write access for the administrators group.
- Specify FTP request filtering options that deny \*.exe, \*.bat, and \*.cmd files.
- Specify FTP request limits for a maximum content length of 1000000 bytes and a maximum URL length of 1024 bytes.
- Block FTP access to the \_vti\_bin virtual directory, which is used with the FrontPage Server Extensions.
- Specify FTP IP filtering options that allow access from 127.0.0.1 and deny access from the 169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0 range of IP addresses.

## Sample Code

The following examples specify FTP request limits for a maximum content length of 1000000 bytes and maximum URL length of 1024 bytes.

### AppCmd.exe
