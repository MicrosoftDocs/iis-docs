# FTP Server Runtime &lt;serverRuntime&gt;

<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<serverRuntime>` element specifies settings that configure how the FTP service operates. More specifically, the `<serverRuntime>` element contains the `<hostNameSupport>` element, which lets you configure whether domain name syntax can be used to specify FTP virtual hosts.

FTP virtual host names were introduced in FTP 7.0, and an FTP virtual host name is specified as part of a binding in the same way that you specify HTTP host header names. For example, you might specify the bindings by using host names like `www.contoso.com` or `www.fabrikam.com` for the HTTP bindings and `ftp.contoso.com` or `ftp.fabrikam.com` for the FTP bindings. HTTP provides a way to pass the host name in the headers that are passed between the client and server, but FTP currently does not provide this same functionality. Because of this FTP limitation, the virtual host name is used as part of the user name during the login process. By default, an FTP client would need to specify its login credentials by using the pipe (vertical line) character with syntax like `ftp.contoso.com|username` or `ftp.fabrikam.com|username`. By setting the `useDomainNameAsHostName` attribute to **true**, you can specify the virtual host and user name by using domain name syntax; this lets you use a backslash character instead of the pipe (vertical line) character; so the syntax would look like `ftp.contoso.com\username` or `ftp.fabrikam.com\username`.

> [!NOTE]
> Both FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 support the proposed FTP HOST command, which does not require that you use the virtual host name as part of the user name.

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The `<serverRuntime>` element was not modified in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<serverRuntime>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<serverRuntime>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<serverRuntime>` element of the `<system.ftpServer>` element was introduced in FTP 7.5 and ships as a feature of IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | N/A |
| IIS 6.0 | N/A |

> [!NOTE]
> The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the modules from the following URL:
>
> [https://www.iis.net/expand/FTP](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp)

With Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5, so downloading the FTP service is no longer necessary.

## How To

### How to configure domain name syntax for virtual host names

> [!NOTE]
> There is no direct user interface that lets you configure the `<hostNameSupport>` element; therefore the following steps will use the IIS Configuration Editor feature.

1. Open **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**: 

    - If you are using Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2: 

        - On the taskbar, click **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, and then click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.
    - If you are using Windows 8 or Windows 8.1: 

        - Hold down the **Windows** key, press the letter **X**, and then click **Control Panel**.
        - Click **Administrative Tools**, and then double-click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.
    - If you are using Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2: 

        - On the taskbar, click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.
    - If you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7: 

        - On the taskbar, click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
        - Double-click **Administrative Tools**, and then double-click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.

3. In the **Home** pane, double-click the **Configuration Editor** feature.
4. In the **Section** drop-down menu, expand **sytem.ftpServer**, and then click **serverRuntime**.
5. Expand **hostNameSupport** in the list view.

> This section contains information about how to modify your IIS settings by using the IIS Configuration Editor. Incorrectly editing your IIS configuration settings can severely damage your IIS installation. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added security, you should back up your IIS configuration settings before you use the IIS Configuration Editor to make any modifications.
