# Environment Variable &lt;environmentVariable&gt;

The `<environmentVariable>` element of the `<environmentVariables>` element adds a unique name/value pair of an environment variable that Internet Information Services (IIS) 7 will pass to a FastCGI process when it is launched.

Each FastCGI application that is installed on IIS 7 may allow or require environment variables to configure how the FastCGI application works. For example, one FastCGI application may require an environment variable that specifies where the application's configuration file is located, whereas another FastCGI application may require an environment variable that specifies the number of requests after which it will need to be recycled.

## Configuration

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Optional string attribute.<br><br>Specifies the name of the environment variable to pass to the FastCGI process. |
| `Value` | Optional string attribute.<br><br>Specifies the value of the environment variable to pass to the FastCGI process. |

### Child Elements

None.

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration sample adds a FastCGI application for PHP, sets the **instanceMaxRequests** attribute to "10000," and sets the **PHP\_FCGI\_MAX\_REQUESTS** environment variable to "10000."

[!code-xml[Main](environmentVariable/samples/sample1.xml)]

> [!NOTE]
> For PHP, the value of the **PHP\_FCGI\_MAX\_REQUESTS** environment variable must be a number that is lesser or equal to the value specified by the **instanceMaxRequests** attribute of the FastCGI `<application>` element.

The following configuration sample adds a global FastCGI handler mapping for PHP files to IIS and specifies the full path to a FastCGI executable file.

[!code-xml[Main](environmentVariable/samples/sample2.xml)]

> [!NOTE]
> FastCGI settings can be configured per-site through the use of specially formatted FastCGI application and by handler mappings, which are distinguished by matching the **fullPath** and **arguments** attributes for an `<application>` element with the corresponding **scriptProcessor** attribute in the `<handlers>` mapping for the FastCGI process. To create these mappings, the settings in the **fullPath** and **arguments** attributes for an `<application>` element must be added to the **scriptProcessor** attribute in the `<handlers>` mapping for the FastCGI process and separated by the pipe "|" character. This combination serves as a unique key for each FastCGI application. For example, the following configuration excerpt shows two example &lt;fastCgi&gt;/&lt;application&gt; elements and their corresponding &lt;handlers&gt; mappings for two site-specific PHP handlers:

Additional information and examples about how to configure FastCGI settings for PHP are discussed in the following walkthrough:

## Sample Code

The following code samples add a FastCGI application for PHP, set the **instanceMaxRequests** attribute to "10000," and set the **PHP\_FCGI\_MAX\_REQUESTS** environment variable to "10000." Each sample also adds a global FastCGI handler mapping for PHP files to IIS and specifies the full path to a FastCGI executable file.

### AppCmd.exe

[!code-console[Main](environmentVariable/samples/sample4.cmd)]

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
