HTTP Logging &lt;httpLogging&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<httpLogging>` element allows you to configure IIS to generate log entries for only successful requests, failed requests, or both. After you configure logging for each Web site at the server level, you can use this element to enable selective logging for individual URLs. By default, HTTP logging is enabled for all requests on Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.

You can view the log file for a site at any time to see which requests are failing and which requests are succeeding. When you no longer want IIS to log certain requests for a site, disable logging for that site.
