# Redirect Headers &lt;redirectHeaders&gt;

<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<redirectHeaders>` element specifies a collection of custom HTTP headers that Internet Information Services (IIS) 7 will add to HTTP redirects.

> [!NOTE]
> HTTP headers are name and value pairs that are returned in responses from a Web server. Unlike custom headers, which are returned in every response from a Web server, redirect headers are returned only when redirection occurs.
