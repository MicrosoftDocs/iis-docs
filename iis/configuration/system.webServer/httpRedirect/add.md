Adding HTTP Wildcard Redirects &lt;add&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<add>` element of the `<httpRedirect>` element adds a wildcard redirection rule to the collection of redirection rules. Wildcard rules allow you to add redirection rules for groups of content. For example, if you have removed all of your \*.asp pages after migrating an application to .NET pages that are using \*.aspx file name extensions, you could add a wildcard redirection rule that redirects all of the \*.asp requests for your old ASP-based application to the home page of your Web site.

> [!NOTE]
> If you add wildcard redirection rules, you must remove the default destination value in the `<httpRedirect>` section in order for the wildcard rules to work.
