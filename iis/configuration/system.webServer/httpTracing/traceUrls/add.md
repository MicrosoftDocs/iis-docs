# Adding Trace URLs &lt;add&gt;

<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<add>` element of the `<traceUrls>` collection adds a trace URL to the collection of URLs for ETW tracing.

> [!NOTE]
> Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a general-purpose, high-speed tracing facility provided by the operating system. Using a buffering and logging mechanism implemented in the kernel, ETW provides a tracing mechanism for events raised by both user-mode applications and kernel-mode device drivers. Additionally, ETW gives you the ability to enable and disable logging dynamically, making it easy to perform detailed tracing in production environments without requiring reboots or application restarts. The logging mechanism uses per-processor buffers that are written to disk by an asynchronous writer thread. This allows large-scale server applications to write events with minimum disturbance.
