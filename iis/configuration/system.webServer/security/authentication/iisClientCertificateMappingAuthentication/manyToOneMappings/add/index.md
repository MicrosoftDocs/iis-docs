# Adding Many-To-One Mappings &lt;add&gt;

<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<add>` element of the `<manyToOneMappings>` element adds unique client certificate mappings to the collection of many-to-one mappings.

Each of the many-to-one mappings are mapped to a user account and password, which can be used in place of the more commonly-used methods of authentication, such as [Windows authentication](../../../windowsauthentication/index.md) or [Basic authentication](../../../basicauthentication.md).

There are two different access methods that you can enable for many-to-one rules: **Allow** or **Deny**. These settings enable you to create rules that will accept groups of client certificates which you will allow access to your site, while denying access to other groups of certificates based on different criteria. For example, you could create a rule that allowed access to all Contoso employees in your Human Resources organization unit, while denying access to employees in the Sales organization unit.

> [!NOTE]
> Many-to-one certificate mappings differ from [one-to-one](../../onetoonemappings/index.md) certificate mappings, which map individual client certificates to individual user accounts.

## How To

There is no user interface for configuring IIS Client Certificate Mapping authentication for IIS 7. For examples of how to configure IIS Client Certificate Mapping authentication programmatically, see the [Code Samples](#006) section of this document.

## Configuration

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Optional string attribute. <br><br>Specifies the description of this one-to-many mapping. |
| `enabled` | Optional Boolean attribute. <br><br>Specifies whether this one-to-many mapping is enabled.<br><br>The default value is `true`. |
| `name` | Required string attribute. <br><br>Specifies the name of this one-to-many mapping. |
| `password` | Optional string attribute. <br><br>Specifies the password of the account used to authenticate clients that match this rule. <br><br>**Note:** To avoid storing unencrypted password strings in configuration files, always use AppCmd.exe or IIS Manager to enter passwords. If you use these management tools, the password strings will be encrypted automatically before they are written to the XML configuration files. This provides better password security than storing unencrypted passwords. |
| `permissionMode` | Optional enum attribute. <br><br>The permissionMode attribute can be one of the following possible values. The default is `Allow`. <table> <tbody> <tr> <th>Value</th> <th>Description</th></tr> <tr> <th><code>Allow</code></th> <td>Specifies that clients with a matching client certificate should be allowed permission to authenticate.<br><br>The numeric value is <code>1</code>. </td></tr> <tr> <th><code>Deny</code></th> <td>Specifies that clients with a matching client certificate should be denied permission to authenticate.<br><br>The numeric value is <code>2</code>. </td></tr></tbody></table> |
| `username` | Optional string attribute. <br><br>Specifies the username of the account used to authenticate clients that match this rule. |

### Child Elements

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`rules`](rules/index.md) | Optional element. <br><br>Specifies criteria for mapping client certificates with IIS so that many clients can use one certificate. |

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration sample performs the following actions for the Default Web Site:

- Enables IIS Client Certificate Mapping authentication using many-to-one certificate mapping.
- Creates a many-to-one certificate mapping rule for a user account based on the organization field in the subject of the client certificate matching Contoso.
- Configures the site to require SSL and to negotiate client certificates.

## Sample Code

The following code samples perform the following actions for the Default Web Site:

- Enable IIS Client Certificate Mapping authentication using many-to-one certificate mapping.
- Create a many-to-one certificate mapping rule for a user account based on the organization field in the subject of the client certificate matching Contoso.
- Configure the site to require SSL and to negotiate client certificates.

### AppCmd.exe

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
