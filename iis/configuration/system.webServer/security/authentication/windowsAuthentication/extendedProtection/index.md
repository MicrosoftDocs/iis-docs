# Windows Extended Protection &lt;extendedProtection&gt;

<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<extendedProtection>` element specifies the settings that configure the extended protection for Windows authentication in IIS 7.5.

Extended protection enhances the existing Windows authentication functionality in order to mitigate authentication relay or "man in the middle" attacks. This mitigation is accomplished by using security information that is implemented through two security mechanisms:

- Channel-binding information that is specified through a Channel Binding Token (CBT), which is primarily used for SSL connections.
- Service-binding information that is specified through a Service Principle Name (SPN), which is primarily used for connections that do not use SSL, or when a connection is established through a scenario that provides SSL-offloading, such as a proxy server or load-balancer.

The `<extendedProtection>` element may contain a collection of `<spn>` elements, each of which contains a unique SPN for the service binding information. Each SPN represents a unique endpoint in the connection path, which may be a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or NetBIOS name of the destination server or a proxy server. For example, if a client is connecting to a destination server through a proxy server, the SPN collection on the destination server would need to contain the SPN for the proxy server. Each SPN in the collection must be prefixed with "HTTP," so the resulting SPN for "www.contoso.com" would be "HTTP/www.contoso.com."

There are two attributes of the `<extendedProtection>` element that configure the channel-binding and additional behavior for IIS extended protection:

- The **tokenChecking** attribute configures the behavior for checking for channel-binding tokens. The possible values for this attribute are: 

    | Name | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `None` | This value specifies that IIS will not perform channel-binding token checking. This setting emulates the behavior that existed before extended protection. <br><br> The numerical value is `0`. |
    | `Allow` | This value specifies that channel-binding token checking is enabled, but not required. This setting allows secure communication with clients that support extended protection, but still supports clients that are not capable of using extended protection. <br><br> The numerical value is `1`. |
    | `Require` | This value specifies that channel-binding token checking is required. This setting does not provide support for clients that do not support extended protection. <br><br> The numerical value is `2`. |
- The **flags** attribute configures additional behavior for extended protection. The possible flags are: 

    | Name | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `None` | This flag specifies that no additional behavior is enabled for extended protection. (For example, no proxy server is being used and SPN checking is enabled and requires FQDNs.) <br><br> The numerical value is `0`. |
    | `Proxy` | This flag specifies that part of the communication path will be through a proxy, or that the client is connecting directly to the destination server over HTTP. <br><br> The numerical value is `1`. |
    | `NoServiceNameCheck` | This flag specifies that SPN checking is disabled; this flag should not be used in scenarios where only SPNs are being checked. <br><br> The numerical value is `2`. |
    | `AllowDotlessSpn` | This flag specifies that SPNs are not required to be FQDNs. Setting this flag allows NetBIOS-based SPNs. **Note:** Setting this flag is not a secure scenario; non-FQDN-based names are vulnerable to name resolution poisoning attacks. <br><br> The numerical value is `4`. |
    | `ProxyCohosting` | This flag specifies that the entire client-to-server communication path will use HTTP only; no part of the communication path will use SSL, and SPN checking will be used. **Note:** When you specify this flag, you must also specify the `Proxy` flag. <br><br> The numerical value is `32`. |

### Extended Protection Scenarios

Consider the following example scenarios:

- In each of the following scenarios, you could also specify the `AllowDotlessSpn` flag if your networking environment supports NetBIOS-based SPNs; however, NetBIOS-based SPNs are not secure.
- For each of the following scenarios where SPN checking will be used and channel-binding token checking will not be used, you should not specify the `NoServiceNameCheck` flag.

| Scenario | Flags | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client connects directly to destination server using HTTP | `Proxy`, `ProxyCohosting` | SPN checking will be used and channel-binding token checking will not be used. |
| Client connects directly to destination server using SSL | `None` | Channel-binding token checking is used and SPN checking is not used. |
| Client connects to destination server through a proxy server using HTTP for the entire path | `Proxy`, `ProxyCohosting` | SPN checking will be used and channel-binding token checking will not be used. |
| Client connects to destination server through a proxy server using SSL for the entire path | `Proxy` | SPN checking will be used and channel-binding token checking will not be used. |
| Client connects to proxy server using SSL and proxy server connects to the destination server using HTTP (SSL off-loading) | `Proxy` | SPN checking will be used and channel-binding token checking will not be used. |

## Setup

The default installation of IIS 7 and later does not include the Windows authentication role service. To use Windows authentication on IIS, you must install the role service, disable Anonymous authentication for your Web site or application, and then enable Windows authentication for the site or application.

> [!NOTE]
> After you install the role service, IIS 7 commits the following configuration settings to the ApplicationHost.config file.
