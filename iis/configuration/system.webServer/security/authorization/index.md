Security Authorization &lt;authorization&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<authorization>` element allows you to configure the user accounts that can access your site or application. Use authorization in combination with authentication to secure access to content on your server. Authentication confirms the identity of a user, while authorization determines what resources users can or cannot access.

IIS defines two types of authorization rules, Allow rules and Deny rules:

- Allow rules let you define the user accounts or user groups that can access a site, an application, or all the sites on a server.
- Deny rules let you define the user accounts or user groups that cannot access a site, an application, or all the sites on a server.

## Configuration

You can configure the `<authorization>` element at the server level in the ApplicationHost.config file, or at the site or application level in the appropriate Web.config file.

You can set default authorization rules for the entire server by configuring authorization rules at the server level. You can remove, clear, or override these rules by configuring more specific rules for your sites or applications.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bypassLoginPages` | Optional Boolean attribute.<br><br>Specifies whether to skip authorization check for the page specified as the login page for Forms authentication. This enables unauthenticated users to access the login page to log on.<br><br>The default value is `true`. |

### Child Elements

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`add`](add.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Adds an authorization rule to the collection of authorization rules. |
| `remove` | Optional element. <br><br>Removes a reference to an authorization rule to the collection of authorization rules. |
| `clear` | Optional element.<br><br>Removes all references to authorization rules from the collection of authorization rules. |

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration example, when included in a Web.config file, removes the default IIS authorization settings, which allows all users access to Web site or application content. It then configures an authorization rule that allows only users with administrator privileges to access the content.

## Sample Code

The following examples add an allow authorization rule that allows users in the administrators group to access a Web site named Contoso.

### AppCmd.exe

[!code-console[Main](index/samples/sample2.cmd)]

> [!NOTE]
> You can optionally set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when using AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file instead of a Web.config file.
