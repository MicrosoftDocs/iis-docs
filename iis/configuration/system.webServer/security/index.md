Security &lt;security&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<security>` section group resides in the `<system.webServer>` section and contains all elements that configure security settings on an Internet Information Services (IIS) 7 server. These include Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) settings for a site, applications that are dependent on Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or Internet Server API (ISAPI) binaries, configuration settings for all authentication modules installed on your server, and authorization rule settings. It also includes IP security and request filtering configuration settings and a list of ISAPI and CGI restrictions on the server.

The settings in the `<security>` section group can be combined for extra security. For example:

- The `<authentication>` element defines configuration sections for all user authentication types that you can install and enable on your IIS 7 server, whereas the `<authorization>` element configures the user accounts that can access your site or application. You use `<authorization>` in combination with `<authentication>` to secure access to content on your server. The `<access>` element configures SSL settings for your Web server, site, or application.
- The `<isapiCgiRestriction>` element specifies a list of CGI and ISAPI applications that can run on IIS 7. This element allows you to ensure that malicious users cannot copy unauthorized CGI and ISAPI binaries to your Web server and then run them. The `<applicationDependencies>` element specifies an application that has dependencies to one or more CGI or ISAPI extension restrictions. You can combine the `<isapiCgiRestriction>` element with the `<applicationDependencies>` element in order to ensure your CGI or ISAPI extension restrictions are set properly.

> [!NOTE]
> For enhanced security, neither Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 installs IIS 7 by default. When you do install IIS 7, IIS is automatically configured to serve only static content, including HTML and image files. You must manually install any other role services and features required by your Web sites and applications. This strategy greatly reduces the IIS 7 attack surface.
