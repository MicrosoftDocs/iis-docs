IP Security &lt;ipSecurity&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<ipSecurity>` element defines a list of IP-based security restrictions in IIS 7 and later. These restrictions can be based on the IP version 4 address, a range of IP version 4 addresses, or a DNS domain name.

| IIS 8.5 | The `<ipSecurity>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `enableProxyMode` attribute was added to enable you to block requests from a client that connects through a proxy. The `denyAction` attribute was added to specify the default deny mode response that IIS sends back to clients. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<ipSecurity>` element was not modified in IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<ipSecurity>` element was introduced in IIS 7.0. |

## Configuration

Rules are processed from top to bottom, in the order they appear in the list. The **allowUnlisted** attribute is processed last. Best practice for Internet Protocol security (IPsec) restrictions is to list Deny rules first. You cannot clear the **allowUnlisted** attribute if it is set to **false**.

The following default `<ipSecurity>` element is configured in the root ApplicationHost.config file in IIS 7 and later. This configuration section inherits the default configuration settings unless you use the `<clear>` element.

[!code-xml[Main](index/samples/sample1.xml)]

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `allowUnlisted` | Optional Boolean attribute.<br><br>Specifies whether to allow unlisted IP addresses. Setting the **allowUnlisted** attribute to **true** allows an unlisted IP address to access the server. Setting the **allowUnlisted** attribute to **false** locks down the server, preventing access to all IP address unless they are listed. If you were to set this attribute to false and do not list the local loopback address (127.0.0.1) as an allowed IP address, you would not be able to access your server by using a browser from a local console.<br><br>This attribute can also affect delegation. If you were to set this attribute to false in a parent configuration, you would not be able use the `<clear>` element to clear this configuration in child configuration files.<br><br>The default value is `true`. |
| `denyAction` | Optional enum attribute.<br><br>Specifies the default deny mode response that IIS should send back to clients. <br><br>The default value is `forbidden`. <table> <tbody> <tr> <th>Value</th> <th>Description</th></tr> <tr> <th><code>AbortRequest</code></th> <td>Specifies that by default IIS should send a deny mode response of <code>Abort</code> back to clients. <p>The numeric value is <code>0</code>.</p></td></tr> <tr> <th><code>Unauthorized</code></th> <td>Specifies that by default IIS should send a deny mode response of <code>Unauthorized</code> back to clients. If a browser-based client is being used at the remote end, returning Unauthorized may cause an authentication dialog to appear at the remote client, resulting in spurious authentication attempts to IIS. <p>The numeric value is <code>401</code>.</p></td></tr> <tr> <th><code>Forbidden</code></th> <td>Specifies that by default IIS should send a deny mode response of <code>Forbidden</code> back to clients. <p>The numeric value is <code>403</code>.</p></td></tr> <tr> <th><code>NotFound</code></th> <td>Specifies that by default IIS should send a deny mode response of <code>Not Found</code> back to clients. <p>The numeric value is <code>404</code>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table> |
| `enableProxyMode` | Optional Boolean attribute.<br><br>Enables IIS not only to block requests from a client IP that is seen by IIS, but also to block requests from IP addresses that are received in the x-forwarded-for HTTP header. This header enables you to identify the originating IP address of a client that connects through an HTTP proxy or load balancer. This is referred to as proxy mode.<br><br>The default value is `false`. |
| `enableReverseDns` | Optional Boolean attribute.<br><br>Specifies whether to enable or disable reverse Domain Name System (DNS) lookups for the Web server. Reverse lookups involve looking up the domain name when the IP address is known.<br><br>**Caution**: Reverse DNS lookups will use significant resources and time.<br><br>The default value is `false`. |

### Child Elements

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`add`](add.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Adds an IP restriction to the collection of IP address restrictions. |
| `remove` | Optional element.<br><br>Removes a reference to a restriction from the `<ipSecurity>` collection. |
| `clear` | Optional element.<br><br>Removes all references to restrictions from the `<ipSecurity>` collection. |

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration sample adds two IP restrictions to the Default Web Site; the first restriction denies access to the IP address 192.168.100.1, and the second restriction denies access to the entire 169.254.0.0 network.

## Sample Code

The following code samples enble reverse DNS lookups for the default web site.

### AppCmd.exe

[!code-console[Main](index/samples/sample3.cmd)]

> [!NOTE]
> You must be sure to set the **commit** parameter to `apphost` when you use AppCmd.exe to configure these settings. This commits the configuration settings to the appropriate location section in the ApplicationHost.config file.
