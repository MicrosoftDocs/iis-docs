## Configuration

The `<add>` element of the `<denyStrings>` element is configured at the site, application, or directory level.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `string` | Required string attribute.<br><br>Specifies a unique string which a request filtering rule will deny.<br><br>There is no default value. |

### Child Elements

None.

### Configuration Sample

The following sample displays a `<requestFiltering>` element that uses the `<denyStrings>`, `<appliesTo>`, and `<scanHeaders>` elements to define a request filtering rule that will prevent image stealing (leeching) for a specific user agent.

[!code-xml[Main](add/samples/sample1.xml)]

The following sample displays a `<requestFiltering>` element that defines a request filtering rule that prevents SQL injection attacks by denying a collection of text strings in query strings that are often used in SQL injection attacks.

## Sample Code

The following examples demonstrate how to use the `<denyStrings>`, `<appliesTo>`, and `<scanHeaders>` elements to add a request filtering rule for the Default Web Site that will prevent image stealing (leeching) for a specific user agent. Here is the scenario for this example: If you detected that images on your web site were being leeched by a particular user agent, you could create a request filtering rule that denies access to image files for that specific user agent. In this particular example, the request filtering rule will search the HTTP user-agent header for the string "leech-bot," and will deny access to GIF, JPG, and PNG files if the user-agent header contains the search string.
