Request Filtering &lt;requestFiltering&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

Request Filtering is a built-in security feature that was introduced in Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0, and replaces much of the functionality that was available through the UrlScan add-on for IIS 6.0. All of the settings for the request filtering feature are located within the `<requestFiltering>` element, which contains several child elements for each of the following feature areas:

- [`<denyUrlSequences>`](denyurlsequences/index.md) - This element can contain a collection of URL sequence patterns that IIS 7 will deny; for example: you can deny parts of URL sequences that an attacker might try to exploit.
- [`<fileExtensions>`](fileextensions/index.md) - This element can contain a collection of file name extensions that IIS 7 will either deny or allow; for example: you can block all requests for Web.config files.
- [`<hiddenSegments>`](hiddensegments/index.md) - This element can contain a collection of URLs that cannot be browsed; for example: you can deny requests for the ASP.NET App\_Code folder.
- [`<requestLimits>`](requestlimits/index.md) - This element contains the settings for URL, content, and query string lengths. It can also contain a collection of user-defined maximum lengths for HTTP headers.
- [`<verbs>`](verbs/index.md) - This element can contain a collection of HTTP verbs that IIS 7 will either deny or allow; for example: you can block all HTTP TRACE requests.

#### New in IIS 7.5

IIS 7.5 added several additional feature areas for request filtering:

- [`<alwaysAllowedUrls>`](alwaysallowedurls/index.md) - This element can contain a collection of URLs that request filtering will always allow.
- [`<alwaysAllowedQueryStrings>`](alwaysallowedquerystrings/index.md) -This element can contain a collection query strings of that request filtering will always allow.
- [`<denyQueryStringSequences>`](denyquerystringsequences/index.md) - This element can contain a collection of query string sequences that request filtering will always deny. This allows administrators to block potentially dangerous query string sequences that they detect.
- [`<filteringRules>`](filteringrules/index.md) - This element can contain a collection of custom request filtering rules. This collection allows administrators to create customized request filtering rules for specific criteria.

#### New in IIS 10.0

IIS 10.0 added the `removeServerHeader` attribute to suppress sending the HTTP server header to remote clients.

#### HTTP 404 Error Substatus Codes

When request filtering blocks an HTTP request, IIS 7 will return an HTTP 404 error to the client and log the HTTP status with a unique substatus that identifies the reason that the request was denied. For example:

| HTTP Substatus | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `404.5` | URL Sequence Denied |
| `404.6` | Verb Denied |
| `404.7` | File Extension Denied |
| `404.8` | Hidden Namespace |
| `404.10` | Request Header Too Long |
| `404.11` | URL Double Escaped |
| `404.12` | URL Has High Bit Chars |
| `404.13` | Content Length Too Large |
| `404.14` | URL Too Long |
| `404.15` | Query String Too Long |
| `404.18` | Query String Sequence Denied |
| `404.19` | Denied by Filtering Rule |

These substatuses allow Web administrators to analyze their IIS logs and identify potential threats.

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The ability to suppress the server header was added in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<requestFiltering>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<requestFiltering>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | In IIS 7.5, request filtering ships with the `unescapeQueryString` attribute and the `alwaysAllowedUrls`, `alwaysAllowedQueryStrings`, `denyQueryStringSequences`, and `filteringRules` elements. These elements were first introduced as an update for IIS 7.0 that is available through [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 957508](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/957508). |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<requestFiltering>` element was introduced in IIS 7.0. |
| IIS 6.0 | The `<requestFiltering>` element replaces the IIS 6.0 UrlScan features. |

## Configuration

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `allowDoubleEscaping` | Optional Boolean attribute.<br><br>If set to **true**, request filtering will allow URLs with doubly-escaped characters. If set to **false**, request filtering will deny the request if characters that have been escaped twice are present in URLs.<br><br>The default value is `false`. |
| `allowHighBitCharacters` | Optional Boolean attribute.<br><br>If set to **true**, request filtering will allow non-ASCII characters in URLs. If set to **false**, request filtering will deny the request if high-bit characters are present in URLs.<br><br>The default value is `true`. |
| `removeServerHeader` | Optional Boolean attribute.<br><br>If set to **true**, request filtering will suppress the IIS server header. If set to **false**, IIS will return the default server header. (Note: This attribute was added in IIS 10.0 and does not work in versions of Windows prior to Windows Server, version 1709 or Windows 10, version 1709.)<br><br>The default value is `false`. |
| `unescapeQueryString` | Optional Boolean attribute.<br><br>If set to **true**, request filtering will perform two passes on each query string scan. The first pass will scan the raw query string, and the second pass will scan the query string after IIS has decoded any escape sequences. If set to **false**, request filtering will only look at the raw query string as sent by the client.<br><br>**Note:** This attribute was added in IIS 7.5.<br><br>The default value is `true`. |

### Child Elements

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`alwaysAllowedQueryStrings`](alwaysallowedquerystrings/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Specifies a collection of query strings that request filtering will always allow.<br><br>**Note:** This element was added in IIS 7.5. |
| [`alwaysAllowedUrls`](alwaysallowedurls/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Specifies a collection of URLs that request filtering will always allow.<br><br>**Note:** This element was added in IIS 7.5. |
| [`denyQueryStringSequences`](denyquerystringsequences/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Specifies a collection of query string sequences that request filtering will always deny.<br><br>**Note:** This element was added in IIS 7.5. |
| [`denyUrlSequences`](denyurlsequences/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Specifies sequences that should be denied to help prevent URL-based attacks on the Web server. |
| [`fileExtensions`](fileextensions/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Specifies which file name extensions are allowed or denied to limit types of requests sent to the Web server. |
| [`filteringRules`](filteringrules/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Specifies a collection of custom request filtering rules.<br><br>**Note:** This element was added in IIS 7.5. |
| [`hiddenSegments`](hiddensegments/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Specifies that certain segments of URLs can be made inaccessible to clients. |
| [`requestLimits`](requestlimits/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Specifies limits on requests processed by the Web server. |
| [`verbs`](verbs/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Specifies which HTTP verbs are allowed or denied to limit types of requests sent to the Web server. |

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration sample from a Web.config file performs several security-related tasks:

- Denies access to two URL sequences. The first sequence prevents directory transversal and the second sequence prevents access to alternate data streams.
- Denies access to unlisted file name extensions and unlisted HTTP verbs.
- Sets the maximum length for a URL to 2KB and the maximum length for a query string to 1KB.
