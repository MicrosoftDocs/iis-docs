# Server Side Include &lt;serverSideInclude&gt;

<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<serverSideInclude>` element specifies whether server-side includes (SSI) #exec directives are disabled for Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.

Specifically, the `<serverSideInclude>` element contains a single attribute: **ssiExecDisable**. Setting the **ssiExecDisable** attribute to **true** will disable the SSI #exec directive for IIS 7, thereby preventing SSI files from executing programs, scripts, or shell commands on the server.

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 10.0 | The `<serverSideInclude>` element was not modified in IIS 10.0. |
| IIS 8.5 | The `<serverSideInclude>` element was not modified in IIS 8.5. |
| IIS 8.0 | The `<serverSideInclude>` element was not modified in IIS 8.0. |
| IIS 7.5 | The `<serverSideInclude>` element was not modified in IIS 7.5. |
| IIS 7.0 | The `<serverSideInclude>` element was introduced in IIS 7.0. |
| IIS 6.0 | The `<serverSideInclude>` element replaces the IIS 6.0 **SSIExecDisable** metabase property. |

> [!NOTE]
> The **cmd** directive for #exec is disabled for SSI files in IIS 7; you can only use the **cgi** directive. For example, you can use the following command with a **cgi** directive:

[!code-xml[Main](serverSideInclude/samples/sample1.xml)]

But you can no longer use the use the following command with a **cmd** directive:

[!code-xml[Main](serverSideInclude/samples/sample2.xml)]

If you attempt to use the **cmd** directive in SSI files on IIS 7, you will receive the following error message:

**The CMD option is not enabled for #EXEC calls**
