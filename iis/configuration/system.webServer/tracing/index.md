Tracing &lt;tracing&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<tracing>` section group contains failed request tracing settings that you have configured and contains trace provider definitions provided during installation or by you on the Internet Information Services (IIS) 7 Web server.

Request-based tracing provides a great way to figure out what exactly is happening with your requests and why it's happening, provided you can reproduce the problem the server is experiencing. Problems like poor performance on some requests, authentication-related failures on other requests, or HTTP 500 status code errors from Active Server Pages (ASP) or ASP.NET can often be incredibly difficult to troubleshoot unless you have captured the trace of the problem when it occurs. Failed-request tracing is designed to buffer the trace events for a request and only flush them to disk when a request fails based on a failure definition that you provide.

IIS 7 only displays these messages after you install and enable the Tracing module. It stores these messages and other tracing information in a special file named the failed event tracing log file. You can open these files in a Web browser and review the trace events generated by IIS, the custom trace events generated by third-party modules, or both. By default, IIS 7 stores these files in the %systemroot%\inetpub\logs\FailedReqLogFiles folder.

The `<tracing>` section contains a `<traceFailedRequests>` element and a `<traceProviderDefinition>` element. The first element configures failed request tracing for your Web site or application, and the second element defines the tracing providers available on the server. By default, IIS 7 includes tracing providers for ASP, ASP.NET, Internet Server API (ISAPI) extensions and the Web server itself. You can also include custom tracing providers.

## Configuration

You can configure the `<tracing>` section group at the server level in the ApplicationHost.config file or at the site level, application level, or directory level in a Web.config file.

### Attributes

None.

### Child Elements

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`traceFailedRequests`](tracefailedrequests/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Contains settings for tracing failed requests on the Web server. |
| [`traceProviderDefinitions`](traceproviderdefinitions/index.md) | Optional element.<br><br>Defines the trace providers that are used on the Web server. |

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration example configures tracing at the server level in the ApplicationHost.config file. It sets tracing for all .aspx files, uses the `<traceAreas>` element to set the **ASPNET** provider and trace against all ASP.NET areas, which are **Infrastructure**, **Module**, **Page** and **AppServices**. The sample also uses the **verbosity** attribute to set the amount of information returned to the tracing file to **warning**. Lastly, the sample uses the `<failureDefinitions>` element to trace only requests that generate a HTTP 404 status code.
