Failure Definitions &lt;failureDefinitions&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

The `<failureDefinitions>` element defines the conditions in which to trace requests. A failure condition consists of status codes, a time interval, or a combination of both. In addition, you can specify the verbosity level for tracing.

> [!NOTE]
> Adding additional verbosity options will configure IIS to return more information in your trace logs, but verbose logs may become quite large. If your log files exceed the maximum file size defined by the **maxLogFileSizeKB** attribute of the `<traceFailedRequestsLogging>` element, your log files will be truncated at the maximum size and you will need to increase the file size that is specified in that attribute.

### How to configure failure definitions

1. Open **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**: 

    - If you are using Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2: 

        - On the taskbar, click **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, and then click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.

## Configuration

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `statusCodes` | Optional string attribute.<br><br>Specifies the status code(s) you want to trace. You can enter multiple status codes in this list by using commas to separate each code. You can also refine your status codes using sub status codes, such as "404.2, 500" or a range of sub status codes such as "400-599". If you do not specify substatus codes, all substatus codes for the given status code will be traced. Status codes must be from 100 to 999, and substatus codes must be from 1 to 999. |
| `timeTaken` | Optional timeSpan attribute.<br><br>Specifies the maximum time that a request may spend in processing before it is marked as failed and then traced.<br><br>The default value is `00:00:00`. |
| `traceAllAfterTimeout` | Optional bool attribute.<br><br>`true` if IIS should continue trace the entire request when a timeout is reached; otherwise, `false` if IIS should truncate the trace when the timeout occurred.<br><br>The default value is `false`. |
| `verbosity` | Optional enum attribute.<br><br>Specifies the minimum amount of information and the type of information that is saved to the trace log. If the verbosity is set to Error, a failed request trace log file for the request will be created when the first trace event whose verbosity is either Error or **CriticalError** is received.<br><br>The verbosity attribute can be one of the following possible values.<br><br>The default value is `Ignore`. <table> <tbody> <tr> <th>Value</th> <th>Description</th></tr> <tr> <th><code>Ignore</code></th> <td>Provides no information about the request activity.<br><br>The numeric value is <code>0</code>.</td></tr> <tr> <th><code>CriticalError</code></th> <td>Provides information about actions that can cause a process to exit or that are about to cause a process to exit.<br><br>The numeric value is <code>1</code>.</td></tr> <tr> <th><code>Error</code></th> <td>Provides information about components that experience an error and cannot continue to process requests. These errors usually indicate a server-side problem.<br><br>The numeric value is <code>2</code>.</td></tr> <tr> <th><code>Warning</code></th> <td>Provides information about components that experience an error but that can continue to process the request.<br><br>The numeric value is <code>3</code>.</td></tr></tbody></table> |

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration example configures tracing at the server level in the ApplicationHost.config file. It sets tracing for all .aspx files, uses the `<traceAreas>` element to set the **ASPNET** provider and trace against all ASP.NET areas, which are **Infrastructure**, **Module**, **Page** and **AppServices**. The sample also uses the **verbosity** attribute to set the amount of information returned to the tracing file to **warning**. Lastly, the sample uses the `<failureDefinitions>` element to trace only requests that generate a HTTP 404 status code.
