Adding Trace Areas &lt;add&gt;
====================
<a id="001"></a>
## Overview

Each `<add>` element in the `<traceAreas>` collection defines the trace provider to use for failed request tracing, the provider-specific areas to enable, and the verbosity level of events to include in the trace.

### Configuration Sample

The following configuration example configures tracing at the server level in the ApplicationHost.config file. It sets tracing for all .aspx files, uses the `<traceAreas>` element to set the **ASPNET** provider and trace against all ASP.NET areas, which are **Infrastructure**, **Module**, **Page** and **AppServices**. The sample also uses the **verbosity** attribute to set the amount of information returned to the tracing file to **warning**. Lastly, the sample uses the `<failureDefinitions>` element to trace only requests that generate a HTTP 404 status code.
