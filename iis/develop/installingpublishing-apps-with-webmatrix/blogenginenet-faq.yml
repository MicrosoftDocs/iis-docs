          1. Open WebMatrix and select **Site from Web Gallery**.

      - question: |
          How do I publish my BlogEngine.NET website?
        answer: |
          To publish a BlogEngine.NET website, use the following steps:
          
          1. In any workspace, on the **Home** tab, in the **Site** group, click **Publish**.
          2. On the **Publishing Settings** dialog, enter the server info you received from your web host.
          3. Because BlogEngine.NET has a default connection string that is not used, you will need to enter a fake connection string.   
           For example: `"Data Source=empty;database=empty;uid=empty;pwd=empty"`
          4. Click **Validate Connection** to ensure that the settings are correct.
          5. Click **Publish**.
          6. After previewing the changes, click **Continue**. Make sure that you do not select the database to be published.

      - question: |
          Why do I get a validation error when trying to edit or add blog posts?
        answer: |
          If you are publishing to a server where the web site is configured to run in a .NET 4 application pool or you changed your local site to run in .NET 4, you will receive this error because the application requires .NET 2.0.
          
          > **Error**: Ooops! An unexpected error has occurred.
          > 
          > The error will also contain the message: "A potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected from the client (ctl00$cphAdmin$txtContent$TinyMCE1$txtContent="
          
          To resolve this issue, use your hosting control panel to set your .NET framework version to 2.0 or 3.5.
