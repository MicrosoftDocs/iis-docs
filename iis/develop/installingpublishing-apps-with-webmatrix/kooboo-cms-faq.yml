          ## Known Issues
          
          **Issue:** You see a "Server Error" when browsing to the site
          
          The application has 4 connection strings, but only 1 will be updated when publishing.
          
          **Workaround:** To resolve this issue, use the following steps:
          
          1. Using WebMatrix, create a copy of the web.config that will be used for the remote web site: 
          
              1. Go to the **Files** workspace.
              2. Copy and paste the *web.config* to create a copy.
              3. Rename *Web - Copy.config* to *web.config.local*.
              4. Open *web.config* and make sure all connection strings use the same remote database server.
              5. Click **Save** on the **Quick Access Toolbar** or press Ctrl + S.
              6. Publish again.
              7. After publishing, browse to your remote web site to verify that the application works.
          2. To switch to the local web.config so that the application works on your client machine: 
          
              1. Rename *web.config* to *web.config.remote*.
              2. Rename *web.config.local* to *web.config*.
              3. Click **Run** or press F12 to open the site in your default web browser.
          3. You will need to switch these files every time you publish.
          
          **Issue:** "Download published siteâ€¦" fails with a database error  
          If you try to download an application from a server and you have administrator credentials in the database connection string in the Publish Settings dialog, you may see this error in the publish log:  
          1:28:29 PM: An error occurred during execution of the database script. The approximate location of the error was between lines '3260' and '3262' of the script. The verbose log may have more information about the error. The command started with :  
          1:28:29 PM: CREATE LOGIN [MACHINE\Administrator] FROM WINDOW  
          1:28:29 PM: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178587](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178587)  
          **Workaround:** Publish the site in the first place using non-administrator credentials for the database in Publish Settings.
