      - question: |
          Why do I get a "We're sorry but a server error has occurred while processing..." message when browsing to my website?
        answer: |
          If you are publishing to a server where your website is running in Medium trust (most hosting providers run in Medium trust), you will see this error message.
          
          To resolve this issue, use the following steps:
          
          1. Go to the **Files** workspace.
          2. Copy and paste the *web.config* file to create a copy.
          3. Rename the *web - Copy.config* file to *web.config.bak*.
          4. Renane *web.mediumtrust.config* to *web.config*.
          5. Publish your website again.
          
      - question: |
          Why do I get a "500 Internal Server Error" when browsing to my website?
        answer: |
          If you are publishing to a server where the web site is configured to run in a .NET 4 application pool, you will receive this error because the application requires .NET 2.0. You will also see the following error message displayed:
          
          > **Error**: The requested page cannot be accessed because the related configuration data for the page is invalid.
          >

          To resolve this issue, use the following steps:
          
          1. Use your hosting control panel to set your .NET framework version to 2.0 or 3.5.
          2. Alternately, using WebMatrix, you can convert the application to use .NET 4: 
          
              1. Go to the **Site** workspace.
              2. Open "Site Settings" by selecting the site node in the navigation pane.
              3. Set the Framework version to .NET 4.
              4. Click **Save** on the **Quick Access Toolbar** or press Ctrl + S.
              5. Go to the **Files** workspace.
              6. Rename *web.config* to *web.config.bak*.
              7. Rename *web.net4.config* to *web.config*.
              8. Click **Run** or press F12 to verify that the application works.
              9. Publish again.
