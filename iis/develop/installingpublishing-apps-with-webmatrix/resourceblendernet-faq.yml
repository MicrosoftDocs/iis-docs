      - question: |
          Why do I get a "500 Internal Server Error" when browsing to my website?
        answer: |
          If you are publishing to a server where the web site is configured to run in a .NET 4 application pool, you will receive this error because the application requires .NET 2.0. You will also see the following error message displayed:
          
          > **Error**: The requested page cannot be accessed because the related configuration data for the page is invalid.
          > 
          > ![image1](resourceblendernet-faq/_static/image1.png)
          
          To resolve this issue, use your hosting control panel to set your .NET framework version to 2.0 or 3.5.
