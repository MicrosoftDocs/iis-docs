          How do I install Sitefinity Community Edition?
        answer: |
          To install Sitefinity Community Edition, use the following steps:
          
          1. Open WebMatrix and select **Site from Web Gallery**.
          2. Select the **CMS** category on the left-hand side.
          3. Find **Sitefinity Community Edition** in the list and install it.
          4. In any workspace, on the **Home** tab, in the **Site** group, click **Run** or press F12 to open the site in your default web browser.
          5. Follow the instructions to complete installation.
          
          Note: If you choose MySQL during the browser installation process, you will need to update the web.config:
          
          1. Go to the **Files** workspace.
          2. Find the following entry:
          
              ```xml
              <connectionStrings><add name="Sitefinity" connectionString="..." providerName="" /></connectionStrings>
              ```
          
          3. Modify the providerName to work with MySQL:
          
              ```xml
              <connectionStrings><add name="Sitefinity" connectionString="..." providerName="MySQL.Data.MySQLClient" /></connectionStrings>
              ```
          
      - question: |
          How do I publish my Sitefinity Community Edition website?
        answer: |
          To publish a Sitefinity Community Edition website, use the following steps:
          
          1. In any workspace, on the **Home** tab, in the **Site** group, click **Publish**.
          2. On the **Publishing Settings** dialog, enter the server info you received from your web host.
          3. For the connection string, you need to copy the connection string from web.config (it will be pointing to a .mdf file in your website) and paste it into the dialog, otherwise publishing will fail.
          4. Click **Validate Connection** to ensure that the settings are correct.
          5. Click **Publish**.
          6. After previewing the changes, click **Continue**.

      - question: |
          Why do I get a "500 Internal Server Error" when browsing to my website?
        answer: |
          If you are publishing to a server where the web site is configured to run in a .NET 4 application pool, you will receive this error because the application requires .NET 2.0. You will also see the following error message displayed:
          
          > **Error**: The requested page cannot be accessed because the related configuration data for the page is invalid.
          > 
          > ![image1](sitefinity-community-edition-faq/_static/image1.png)
          
          To resolve this issue, use your hosting control panel to set your .NET framework version to 2.0 or 3.5.
