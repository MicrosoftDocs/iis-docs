          **Issue**: Subtext gives a "Server Error in '/' Application" when you download a published site
          
          **Workaround #1**: Open up the site's web.config file and replace the user ID and password in the database connection string with the SQL Server administrator credentials (i.e. "sa" credentials).
          
          **Workaround #2**: Give the user account you are logged in with db\_owner permissions.
          
          1. Install SQL Server Management Studio using the Web Platform Installer
          2. Connect to your local SQL server (.\SQLEXPRESS by default)
          3. Click Databases &gt; [localSubtextDatabase] &gt; Security &gt; Users &gt; [localSubtextuser - default is "subtextuser"] and right-click for properties. Check the box for "db\_owner" in the role membership section.
