## Installing and Publishing WordPress

1. Open WebMatrix and select **Site from Web Gallery**.
2. Select the **Blogs** category on the left-hand side.

4. In any workspace, on the **Home** tab, in the **Site** group, click **Run** or press F12 to open the site in your default web browser.
5. Follow the instructions to complete installation.

#### Q: How do I publish my WordPress website?

A: To publish a WordPress website, use the following steps:

1. In any workspace, on the **Home** tab, in the **Site** group, click **Publish**.
2. On the **Publishing Settings** dialog, enter the server info you received from your web host.
3. Click **Validate Connection** to ensure that the settings are correct.
4. Click **Publish**.

Known Issues

**Issue:** Wordpress fail to publish with a database error indicating that a particular line of SQL could not be processed  
WebMatrix installs MySQL with the UTF-8 character set by default. If you install MySQL on your own, and the character set is not UTF-8 (e.g. it may be Latin1), publishing databases may fail  
**Workaround:** 1) Change the character set for MySQL to UTF-8. [More information](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-server.html).  
2) Re-install the application  
3) Re-publish the application
