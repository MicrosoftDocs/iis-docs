# Extending Web Server Functionality in .NET

by IIS Team

Building Web server add-ons and extensions is simpler and less time-consuming because IIS 7.0 supports .NET extensibility through the IHTTPModule and IHTTPHandler interfaces that ASP.NET developers already know and use today. This tutorial covers building a .NET module starting with the Managed Module Kit, implementing the IHTTPModule interface, attaching EventHandlers to pipeline events and configuring IIS 7.0 to use the module in the request pipeline.
