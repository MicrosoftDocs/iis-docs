WebMatrix Publish and Download Troubleshooting
====================
by Faith A

Use this troubleshooting guide when you are run into problems with publishing or downloading sites in WebMatrix.

### Publishing Errors

- Bad gateway / proxy error
- "Could not connect to the remote computer"
- "Could not connect to the destination computer"
- "Connected to the remote computer ("computername") using the Web Management Service, but could not authorize"
- "Unable to read beyond the end of the stream"
- "Could not complete the request to remote agent URL"

#### Bad gateway / proxy error

**Cause:** A proxy server is most likely blocking access to the server.

**Things You Can Try:** Try installing your corporation's required firewall client, and disabling all settings in Internet Explorer &gt; Tools &gt; Options &gt; Connections &gt; LAN settings.

#### Could not connect to the remote computer

**Cause:** The server was contacted but did not respond to the publishing. This is often due to the Web Management Service not being started on the server.

**Things You Can Try:** Contact your server administrator or hosting provider.

#### Could not connect to the destination computer

**Cause:** The server was contacted but did not respond to the publishing. This is often due to the Web Management Service not being started on the server.

**Things You Can Try:** Contact your server administrator or hosting provider.

#### Connected to the remote computer using the Web Management Service, but could not authorize

**Cause:** WebMatrix connected to the server, but your username is not authorized for the site name.

**Things You Can Try:** Check the publish settings to verify that your site name is correct. If everything looks correct, contact your server administrator or hosting provider.

#### Unable to read beyond end of the stream

**Cause:** Either the server or a device such as a router between your computer and the server closed the connection. This can be due to firewall or server configuration.

**Things You Can Try:** If you still get this error consistently after several publishing attempts, try when connected to another network. If it still occurs, contact your server administrator or hosting provider.

#### Could not complete the request to remote agent URL

**Cause:** This is a transient issue when the network is busy.

**Things You Can Try:** Try the publishing again. If it continues to happen, contact your server administrator or hosting provider.
