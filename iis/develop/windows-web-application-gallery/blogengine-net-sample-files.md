Blogengine .NET Sample files
====================
by Steve Jacobson

This is a set of sample files you could use with Blogengine .NET and the Web Deployment tool for deploying it on IIS. The `manifest.xml` and `parameters.xml` here are used to set the appropriate permissions and deploy the files to a web server . This application uses a file data store within App\_Data directory and hence requires that this directory have ReadAndExecute,Write,Delete permissions .

The files are annotated with comments that explain specific lines in the files you'll need to customize for your configuration.

## Sample manifest.xml file

[!code-xml[Main](blogengine-net-sample-files/samples/sample1.xml)]

## Sample parameters.xml

[!code-xml[Main](blogengine-net-sample-files/samples/sample2.xml)]
