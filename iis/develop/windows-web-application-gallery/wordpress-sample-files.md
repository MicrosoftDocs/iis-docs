WordPress Sample files
====================
by [Sunitha Muthukrishna](https://github.com/SunBuild)

This is a set of sample files you could use with Wordpress and the Web Deployment tool for deploying Wordpress onto IIS. The files are annotated with comments that explain specific lines in the files you'll need to customize for your configuration.

## Sample manifest.xml file

[!code-xml[Main](wordpress-sample-files/samples/sample1.xml)]

## Sample parameters.xml file

[!code-xml[Main](wordpress-sample-files/samples/sample2.xml)]

## Sample install.sql file

[!code-console[Main](wordpress-sample-files/samples/sample3.cmd)]
