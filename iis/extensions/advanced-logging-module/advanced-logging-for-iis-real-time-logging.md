# Advanced Logging for IIS - Real-Time Logging

by [Vishal Sood](https://twitter.com/vishalsood)

IIS Advanced Logging can extend the web platform to support real-time analytics, helping you to provide real-time reports to customers or work with partners to do the same. The Advanced Logging feature contains an option that enables consumption of log entries in real-time. It aggregates all of the events sent to it during each request and the log definition property ***publishLogEvent*** controls whether real-time events are raised for consumption by other applications.

## Requirements

- This article is intended for developers and assumes basic native code writing skills.
- An understanding of the IIS pipeline isn't required; however, it might help to review the articles listed in the [References](advanced-logging-for-iis-real-time-logging.md#references) section to learn more about the methods and data structures that are used.
- For information about how to install and use IIS Advanced Logging, see [Advanced Logging for IIS - Custom Logging](advanced-logging-for-iis-custom-logging.md).

## Enabling Real-time Logging

Real-time logging is a per-log-definition setting in IIS Advanced Logging. To enable real-time logging for a log definition, do the following:

1. In IIS Manager, open the Advanced Logging feature. Click the server in the **Connections** pane, and then double-click the **Advanced Logging** icon on the **Home** page.

2. Enable the Advanced Logging feature. In the **Actions** pane, click **Enable Advanced Logging**.

3. Select the log definition for which you want to enable real-time logging.

   1. In IIS Manager, open the Advanced Logging feature at the server, website, directory, or application level.
   2. In the **Advanced Logging** feature page, click the log definition, and then in the **Actions** pane, click **Edit Log Definition**.

4. Enable real-time logging of events for the selected log definition by selecting the **Publish real-time events** check box.

5. Write an IIS module that consumes the events in real time, as described in the following [section](advanced-logging-for-iis-real-time-logging.md#module).

## Writing an IIS Module to Consume Real-Time Events

To log the real-time events raised by the Advanced Logging feature, you must create an IIS module. This section reviews the IIS tracing infrastructure and provides sample code in a compressed (zipped) folder for creating a simple module that you can use as a reference.

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code hasn't been tested for memory leaks and other issues and is intended to be used as a reference only.

### IIS Tracing Infrastructure

This section describes some IIS tracing concepts that are used for logging real-time events.

#### IGlobalTraceEventProvider::GetTraceEvent Method

To consume the real-time events raised by Advanced Logging, the IIS module that you create must register for global events. The **OnGlobalTraceEvent** method should be called for every event that is raised by the system. Registering for it gives you access to the real-time logging events. For more information, see [CGlobalModule::OnGlobalTraceEvent Method](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9656643).

#### Data Structures

##### HTTP\_TRACE\_EVENT Structure

The **HTTP\_TRACE\_EVENT** structure forms the backbone of the real-time logging infrastructure. The real-time logging information is passed in the form of this structure.

[!code-console[Main](advanced-logging-for-iis-real-time-logging/samples/sample1.cmd)]

For more information about this structure, see [HTTP\_TRACE\_EVENT Structure](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9656644).

##### HTTP\_TRACE\_EVENT\_ITEM Structure

The **HTTP\_TRACE\_EVENT** structure contains one or more **HTTP\_TRACE\_EVENT\_ITEM** structures, depending on the number of logging fields included in the log definition for which a log was generated.

[!code-console[Main](advanced-logging-for-iis-real-time-logging/samples/sample2.cmd)]

For more information about this structure, see [HTTP\_TRACE\_EVENT\_ITEM Structure](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9656645).

#### pProviderGuid

The HTTP\_TRACE\_EVENT structure contains the **pProviderGuid** property, an LPCGUID that contains the provider identifier. It's important to understand its significance.

As described in [CAnalyticsGlobalModule::OnGlobalTraceEvent](advanced-logging-for-iis-real-time-logging.md#canalyticsglobalmodule), **OnGlobalTraceEvent** is called for every event that is raised by the system. This means that you must filter unwanted events from the incoming events so that only the events of interest (real-time logging events) are available for consumption. You can do this by using the **pProviderGuid** property value **3C729B22-F9A9-4096-92A4-07E0DDF403EB**.

[!code-csharp[Main](advanced-logging-for-iis-real-time-logging/samples/sample3.cs)]

The [Sample Code](advanced-logging-for-iis-real-time-logging.md#samplecode) uses this value to filter out the unwanted events.

### Sample Code

This section displays sample code that illustrates the real-time logging concepts described previously in this article.

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code hasn't been tested for memory leaks and other issues and is intended to be used as a reference only.

#### CAnalyticsGlobalModule::OnGlobalTraceEvent

[!code-csharp[Main](advanced-logging-for-iis-real-time-logging/samples/sample4.cs)]

#### ProcessLogEvent

The **ProcessLogEvent** method copies the logging data into a local data structure so that it can be used later to push data to a web service or database.

> [!NOTE]
> The data in the request itself shouldn't be processed as that might cause the request to slow responses to clients.

> [!NOTE]
> The code for **ProcessLogEvent** should be aware that memory used by events might be temporary memory allocated by **AllocateRequestMemory**. To unblock the thread, the data should be copied.

## Summary

In this walkthrough, we reviewed how real-time logging works in the IIS Advanced Logging feature and how to consume logging data in real-time by creating a simple IIS module.
