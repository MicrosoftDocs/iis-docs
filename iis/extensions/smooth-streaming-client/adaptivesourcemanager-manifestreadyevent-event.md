# AdaptiveSourceManager.ManifestReadyEvent Event

**Applies to:** Windows Store apps only

Adds or removes a subscription to ManifestReadyEvent events. Those events fire when the manifest is ready.

## Syntax

```csharp
public event ManifestReadyEventHandler ManifestReadyEvent
```

```cpp
public:
virtual  event ManifestReadyEventHandler^ ManifestReadyEvent {
void add (ManifestReadyEventHandler^ value);
void remove (ManifestReadyEventHandler^ value);
}
```

## Event information

## Remarks

Subscribing to events at the AdaptiveSourceManager level means that all ManifestReadyEvent events from all AdaptiveSource objects will be handled by this event handler. If you want to differentiate the AdaptiveSources, you need to get the AdaptiveSource.Uri or listen to individual events under each AdaptiveSources object.

## Requirements
