# IIS Smooth Streaming Manifest Structure

The Smooth Streaming extensions in IIS Media Services provide the ability to dynamically generate media fragments for delivery to clients from contiguous video in Fragmented MP4 (a variant of the ISO/IEC 14996-12 ISO Base Media File Format). This reference specifies the formats and schemas of manifest files that encoders generate and developers create to support Smooth Streaming.

The manifest reference is organized into the following technical sections.

|Section|Description|
|--- |--- |
|[IIS Smooth Streaming Server Manifest (On-Demand)](iis-smooth-streaming-server-manifest-on-demand.md)|Specifies the format and semantics of the manifest used by the server for on-demand Smooth Streaming scenarios.|
|[IIS Smooth Streaming Server Manifest (Live)](iis-smooth-streaming-server-manifest-live.md)|Specifies the format and semantics of the manifest used by the server for live Smooth Streaming scenarios.|
|[IIS Smooth Streaming Client Manifest](iis-smooth-streaming-client-manifest.md)|Specifies the format and semantics of manifest used by IIS Smooth Streaming Client applications for Smooth Streaming scenarios.|
