# IIS URL Rewrite

IIS URL Rewrite enables web administrators to create powerful rules to implement URLs that are easier for users to remember and easier for search engines to find. By using rule templates, rewrite maps, .NET providers, and other functionality integrated into IIS Manager, web administrators can easily set up rules to define URL rewriting behavior based on HTTP headers, HTTP response or request headers, IIS server variables, and even complex programmatic rules. In addition, web administrators can perform redirects, send custom responses, or stop HTTP requests based on the logic expressed in the rewrite rules.
