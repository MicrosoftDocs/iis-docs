# IIS Web Playlists

Web Playlists is an IIS Media Services extension that provides developers and hosters unprecedented control of how media content is delivered to users. Powerful customization features make it possible to monetize media delivery scenarios by inserting in-stream or pre-roll video ads and dynamically determine the content to be delivered based on the session history and configurable server-side rules.

The IIS Web Playlists SDK allows developers to extend the default behavior through the development of custom providers. The SDK provides a COM interface that supports implementation in either .NET or native code providers.
