Installing IIS 7 on Windows Vista and Windows 7
====================
by IIS Team

## Introduction

Advances in cloud technologies have led many users to use [Windows Azure Web Sites](https://www.windowsazure.com/solutions/web/) to host both a production site and test site, as it makes it easy to test various configurations without impacting their own personal computers. If you still prefer to do this on your desktop, you can install IIS on it, as well as other applications and extensions easily using the Microsoft速 Web Platform Installer (Web PI). To learn more about the Web PI, see [Learn about and install the Web PI](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=145510).

If you choose to install IIS 7.0 or above manually, you can use this article for guidance.

## Before You Begin

Ensure that you have installed one of the editions of Windows Vista or Windows 7 on which IIS 7 and above is supported before you proceed. Not all IIS features are supported on all editions of Windows Vista and Windows 7. Home Basic and Starter editions include only limited basic features of IIS. To see a list of which features are supported on the edition of Windows you are using, see one of the following:

- [Available Role Services in IIS 7.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=166549) (Windows Vista)
- [Available Web Server (IIS) Role Services in IIS 7.5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=166491) (Windows 7)

Also be sure that you have administrative user rights on the computer. By default, you do not have administrative user rights if you are logged on as a user other than the built-in administrator, even if you were added to the local Administrators group on the computer (this is a new security feature in Windows Server速 2008 called Local User Administrator). Log on either to the built-in administrator account, or explicitly invoke applications as the built-in administrator by using the runas command-line tool.

Note that you can run runas /user:administrator cmd.exe so that every application you run from that command line will be elevated, eliminating the need to use the runas syntax from that command line.

If you are logged on to an account other than the built-in local administrator account, you may see the following security alert dialog box.

If you want to use ASP, Microsoft速 ASP.NET, or PHP, install the modules needed to host these pages; this can be done during the installation of IIS or after the installation is complete.

## Use Unattended Setup to Install IIS 7.0 and above

IIS can also be installed unattended on Windows Vista. For detailed instructions and scripts, see [Using Unattended Setup to Install IIS 7.0 and Above](using-unattended-setup-to-install-iis.md).
