# Installing IIS 8.5 on Windows Server 2012 R2

This document describes how to install Internet Information Services (IIS) 8.5 on Windows Server® 2012 R2. IIS is the Web server role in Windows Server 2012 R2. The Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system has all the IIS features needed to support the hosting of Web content in production environments. Windows 8 also includes IIS features, but feature availability depends on the operating system version.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the procedures in this document to install IIS 8.0 or IIS 8.5.

The Web server has a modular design that enables you to customize a server by adding or removing modules to meet your specific needs. The [**Install IIS 8.5 on Windows Server 2012 R2**](#InstallIIS85onWindowsServer2012R2) section describes how to install modules, and the [**Modules in IIS 8.5**](#ModulesinIIS85) section below describes the functionality that each module provides and which modules are installed by default.

## New in IIS 8.5

IIS 8.5 includes several new features not found in IIS 8.0 or lower:

- Enhanced logging. An administrator can enable the logging of additional custom fields from request or response headers, or from server variables.
- Logging to event tracing for Windows. An administrator can enable the sending of logging information to Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).
- Dynamic Website activation. If there are a large number of configured sites (100 or greater, by default), the service will not activate any of the sites when the service is started.
- Idle Worker Process Page-Out. An administrator can enable an idle worker process to be suspended rather than terminated.

For more information on these features, see [What's New in IIS 8.5](../../get-started/index.md).

For information on new features in IIS 8.0, see [What's New in IIS 8.0](../../get-started/whats-new-in-iis-8/index.md).

## Before You Begin

Ensure that you have administrative user rights on the computer on which you plan to install IIS 8.5. Note that by default, you do not have administrative user rights if you are logged on as a user other than as the built-in administrator, even if you were added to the local Administrators group on the computer.

Log on either to the built-in administrator account, or explicitly invoke applications as the built-in administrator by using the **runas** command-line tool.

> [!NOTE]
> You can run **runas /user:administrator cmd.exe** so that every application you run from that command line will be elevated, eliminating the need to use the **runas** syntax from that command line.

If you are logged on to an account other than the built-in local administrator account, you may see the following security alert dialog box.

## Install IIS 8.5 on Windows Server 2012 R2

IIS is one of the server roles on Windows Server 2012 R2, named Web Server (IIS). You can use the following to install IIS:

- The Server Manager user interface in Windows Server 2012 R2
- A command-line installation using DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management)
- A command-line installation using PowerShell cmdlets

> [!NOTE]
> IIS can also be installed on Windows 8 through the **Turn Windows features on or off** dialog box from the **Programs and Features** settings of the Control Panel.

### Install IIS 8.5 using the Server Manager

Server Manager provides a single dashboard to install or uninstall server roles, role services, and features. Server Manager also gives an overview of all currently installed roles and features.

When you install IIS 8.5 using the Windows Server 2012 R2 Server Manager, the steps you perform are different when you install IIS for the first time, as opposed to when you add roles, services, or features to an existing IIS installation. The two procedures are provided below. Different procedures are also used to add and remove roles, role services, and features. You cannot add and remove from the same UI

For more information on how to run the installation wizards in Server Manager, see [Install or Uninstall Roles, Role Services, or Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831809(v=ws.11)).

#### Install IIS 8.5 for the first time in the Server Manager

When the Web Server (UI) role is chosen for the first time in the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** in Server Manager, the basic components and services needed for IIS are automatically selected. The following procedure will install Internet Information Services on a running physical server when IIS has not already been installed. To change an existing installation of IIS, perform the next procedure, Install additional role services for IIS. These two procedures involve different steps.

1. Open Server Manager by clicking the **Server Manager** icon on the desktop.
2. In the **Server Manager** window, with the **Dashboard** and **Quick Start** selected, click **Add roles and features**, or click the **Manage** menu, and then click **Add Roles and Features**. The Add Roles and Features Wizard will start with a **Before You Begin** page. The wizard asks for verification of the following:

    - The administrator account has a strong password.
    - The network settings, such as IP addresses, are configured.
    - The most current security updates from Windows® Update are installed.
3. On the **Before You Begin** page, click **Next**.
4. On the **Installation Type** page, select **Role-based or feature-based installation** to configure a single server. Click **Next**.

    ![Installation Type page](installing-iis-85-on-windows-server-2012-r2/_static/image2.jpg)
5. On the **Server Selection** page, select **Select a server from the server pool**, and then select a server; or select **Select a virtual hard disk server**, select a server to mount the VHD on, and then select a VHD file. Click **Next**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To connect to the virtual hard disk, the virtual machine must be turned off and disconnected. If you select a VHD file from a network share, that share must grant Read and Write permissions to the computer (local system) account of the server that you selected to mount the VHD (user-only account access is not sufficient).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Servers in a server pool will be available only if they have been added by the Add other servers to manage command in Server Manager.

    ![Server Select page](installing-iis-85-on-windows-server-2012-r2/_static/image3.jpg)
6. On the **Server Roles** page, select **Web Server (IIS)**.

10. On the **Web Server Role (IIS)** page, click **Next**.
11. On the **Role Services** page, select any additional role services that you want to install.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you install IIS for the first time by selecting **Web Server (IIS)**, you will get at least the default installation that includes a minimum set of role services. You can see at this point that those default services are preselected on the Server Roles page. For a list of the server roles available, and which roles are installed by default, see [**Modules in IIS 8.5**](#ModulesinIIS85). You will have the chance to select more role services later in this procedure.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also deselect role services that were selected by default when you selected **Web Server**. However, at least one role service must be selected for Web Server to be selected and installed.

    ![Role Services page](installing-iis-85-on-windows-server-2012-r2/_static/image7.jpg)
12. If you selected a role service that requires other role services or features to be installed, a page will be opened indicating the role services or features to be installed.

### Install IIS 8.5 from the Command Line

You can install IIS 8.5 from the command line using DISM or PowerShell. Note that DISM and PowerShell have different namespaces for installation parameters, so the parameter names used in their commands will be different. For more information, see [**Modules in IIS 8.5**](#ModulesinIIS85).

> [!NOTE]
> Pkgmgr.exe has been deprecated. Use DISM instead for scripts installing IIS 8.5.

#### Install IIS 8.5 using DISM

Automating the installation of IIS by using unattended scripts is very useful if you need to deploy multiple Web servers and want to ensure that each of the Web servers is set up with identical components and services. In Windows Server 2012 R2, DISM is used for unattended scripts, letting you install or uninstall optional features from a command prompt or scripts. To use DISM, you must make sure you have administrative user rights on the computer. For more information about DISM, see [DISM Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/what-is-dism)

If you do not explicitly include in the DISM code a feature that the IIS installation has a dependency on, the installation will fail, and will not generate an error message. For a list of dependencies required, see [**Feature Dependencies**](#FeatureDependencies).

For a full list of the DISM parameters corresponding to IIS roles, services, and features, see [**Modules in IIS 8.5**](#ModulesinIIS85).

The following script will install all roles, role services, and features of IIS 8.5, getting the full IIS installation that includes all available feature packages. If there are roles, role services, or features that you do not need, you should edit the script to include only those that you require. The order of the commands in the DISM script does not matter. The entire script will be handed off to the engine and treated as one transaction. To install IIS 8.5 with a script, type the following on one line in an elevated command prompt.

[!code-console[Main](installing-iis-85-on-windows-server-2012-r2/samples/sample1.cmd)]

#### Install IIS 8.5 using PowerShell

You can use the following PowerShell cmdlets to install all of IIS 8.5:

[!code-powershell[Main](installing-iis-85-on-windows-server-2012-r2/samples/sample2.ps1)]

To install only specific features, list them in the PowerShell cmdlet, as in the following example:

[!code-powershell[Main](installing-iis-85-on-windows-server-2012-r2/samples/sample3.ps1)]

The following points apply to running the PowerShell cmdlets:

- The cmdlet requires elevation. You must be running a Windows PowerShell session as an administrator to run the cmdlet.
- The cmdlet does not install management tools for roles, role services, and features by default. You must add the IncludeManagementTools parameter to the cmdlet to do so.

For a full list of the PowerShell parameters corresponding to IIS 8.5 roles, services, and features, with more information, see [**Modules in IIS 8.5**](#ModulesinIIS85). The following lists all these parameters.

- Web-Server
- Web-WebServer
- Web-Security

#### Uninstall IIS 8.5 using PowerShell

You can use the PowerShell cmdlet UnInstall-WindowsFeature to uninstall IIS 8.5. Run **get-help Install-WindowsFeature** at a PowerShell command line to see the syntax of the cmdlet. The following points apply to running the cmdlet:

- The cmdlet requires elevation. You must be running a Windows PowerShell session as an administrator to run the cmdlet.
- The cmdlet does not uninstall management tools for roles, role services, and features by default. You must add the IncludeManagementTools parameter to the cmdlet to do so.

### Feature Dependencies

The following table shows which role services and features must be installed for the role service or features in the table row to be installed.

The **Add Roles and Features Wizard** and **Remove Roles and Features Wizard** of Server Manager take care of dependencies by prompting you to add dependencies when adding a role service or feature, or to remove dependencies when removing a role service or feature. However, when you install IIS using DISM, you need to include in the DISM code any dependency that a role service or feature being installed has, or the installation will fail, and you may not receive an indication why it failed.

When you remove a role service or feature, make sure that you do not remove a service or feature that another service or feature has a dependency on. There can be an intersection of dependencies, for example between ASP and ASP.NET. So if you were to remove ASP, and remove its feature dependencies, you could remove dependencies for ASP.NET, as well.
