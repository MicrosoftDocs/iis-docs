## Performance Tuning

This [guide](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/7/5/E75F1B3E-C341-4E67-906A-24ABB0E59278/PerformanceTuningWS2008.zip) describes important tuning parameters and settings that can result in improved performance for the Windows ServerÂ® 2008 operating system. Each setting and its potential effect are described to help you make an informed judgment about its relevance to your system, workload, and performance goals. The guide uses a holistic approach toward tuning Windows Server's various roles, including the Web Server role.
