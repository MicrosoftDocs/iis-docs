# Smooth Streaming Technical Overview

by [Alex Zambelli](https://twitter.com/zambelli24fps)

The [Smooth Streaming](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/smooth-streaming "IIS Smooth Streaming") extension for Internet Information Services (IIS) dynamically detects local bandwidth and CPU conditions and seamlessly switches, in near real time, the video quality of a media file that a player receives. Consumers with high-bandwidth connections can experience high definition (HD) quality streaming while others with lower bandwidth speeds receive the appropriate stream for their connectivity, allowing consumers across the board to enjoy a compelling, uninterrupted streaming experience and alleviating the need for media companies to cater to the lowest common denominator quality level within their audience base.
