# IIS Smooth Streaming Format SDK Readme

by Dave Nelson

June 2010

These release notes are for the Beta 2 release of the IIS Smooth Streaming Format Software Development Kit 1.0.

This release is provided under the IIS Smooth Streaming Format SDK license terms that accompany this package.

The package makes it easy for authorized developers to wrap encoded video and audio bitstreams into fragmented-MP4 (f-MP4) formats that conform to Smooth Streaming requirements.

Updated documentation for the Smooth Streaming Format SDK is available on [MSDN>](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=183331).

## Known Issues in this Release

- You can currently only target platforms that match the installed SDK. That is, if you install the x86–based package, you can only target x86-based applications. If you install the x64-based package, you can only target x64-based applications.
- If Visual Studio 2008 fails to open the BasicMux project from the x64-based package, it is likely that Visual Studio 2008 was installed with the x64-based compiler and tools. By default, Visual Studio 2008 must be installed with the x86- based compiler, even on x64-based operating systems. You must explicitly select the x86-based compiler option when installing Visual Studio 2008, or you can reinstall Visual Studio 2008, and select the option.
