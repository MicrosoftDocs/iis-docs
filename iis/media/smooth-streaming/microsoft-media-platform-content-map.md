Microsoft Media Platform Content Map
====================
by Dave Nelson

The Microsoft Media Platform is a complete technology platform for deploying a highly available, highly scalable, Smooth Streaming media delivery environment. The platform contains the following technologies:

- **Content preparation**. [Microsoft Expression Encoder](http://expression.microsoft.com/cc136533.aspx), [IIS Transform Manager](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/transform-manager)
- **Content delivery**. [IIS Media Services](https://www.iis.net/media)
- **Content playback**. [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/)

This portal page is designed to help you to deploy the Microsoft Media Platform by providing links to the best available best practices and guidance, organized in the following categories:

- [Creating Smooth Streams](microsoft-media-platform-content-map.md#create)
- [Delivering Smooth Streams](microsoft-media-platform-content-map.md#deliver)
- [Managing Smooth Streams](microsoft-media-platform-content-map.md#manage)
- [Playing Smooth Streams](microsoft-media-platform-content-map.md#play)
- [Progressively Downloading Media](microsoft-media-platform-content-map.md#download)
