## Introduction

Smooth Streaming Client SDKs enable you to build rich on-demand and live Smooth Streaming experiences for [Silverlight](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9735130) and [Windows Phone](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9745649) applications that take full advantage of the capabilities of the Smooth Streaming extensions in [IIS Media Services](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9735131). The [Smooth Streaming Client Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9811178) provide an easy-to-use interface for developers and designers to create rich Smooth Streaming experiences on Silverlight and Windows Phone platforms. The APIs provide support for simple operations such as Play, Pause, and Stop and also more complex operations such as scheduling advertisements, selecting and tracking bitrates for Smooth Streaming playback, and many more. Smooth Streaming Client is used in the [Microsoft Media Platform: Player Framework (MMPPF)](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9745652). This partnership facilitates faster player development.

Smooth Streaming Client includes SDK DLLs with APIs for both desktop Silverlight client development and for Windows Phone development. For more information, see [Package contents](smooth-streaming-client-readme.md#package).

Smooth Streaming Client SDKs support the following high-level features:

- For developing Windows Phone applications, install the [Windows Phone Developer Tools](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9745657) and the [Windows Phone Developer Tools January 2011 Update](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9767590). For more information about Windows Phone development, see the [Windows Phone App Hub](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9745653).
- For testing your applications on client computers, your Macintosh or Windows client computer must be running an Internet browser supported by Silverlight 4, such as Internet Explorer, Safari, or Firefox.

## Known issues

**Microsoft Smooth Streaming Client 2.0**

- IIS Media Services low-latency live Smooth Streaming isn't supported.
- Playback of encrypted streams isn't supported in Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode.
- Rewinding an encrypted stream back to the beginning will close the stream.
- Non-sparse tracks in a stream should have the same fragment duration and lookahead values as audio and video tracks in the stream to enable synchronization.
- For linear-ad insertion to work, the main content stream and ad stream must be encoded using identical codecs, resolutions, and encoding profiles.
- When a media stream transitions from a linear clip to a linear ad (or vice-versa), the [LinearClipChanged](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.linearclipchanged(VS.95).aspx) event might fire twice. The extra event can be ignored.
- If a user pauses a linear ad that's inserted in front of a live stream (a linear "preroll ad"), playback might not transition to the current live playback point when the linear ad finishes. To work around this issue, you can configure your client application to not allow pausing playback of the linear ad or you can call the [StartSeekToLive](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.startseektolive(VS.95).aspx) method after the ad finishes.
- The first Seek operation after the [MediaOpened](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.mediaopened(VS.95).aspx) event might be ignored.
- The [Stop](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.stop(VS.95).aspx) method shouldn't be used during playback of live Smooth Streams.
- Calling the [SelectTracks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.streaminfo.selecttracks(VS.95).aspx) method or the [RestrictTracks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.streaminfo.restricttracks(VS.95).aspx) method during the [ManifestReady](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.manifestready(VS.95).aspx) event doesn't update the [SelectedTracks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.streaminfo.selectedtracks(VS.95).aspx) property until after the ManifestReady event handler exits.
- You can call [BufferingTime](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.bufferingtime(VS.95).aspx) Set and Get anytime, but only the last Set before assignment of [SmoothStreamingSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.smoothstreamingsource(VS.95).aspx) is used. If you call Set after setting SmoothStreamingSource, and then call Get, the updated value is returned even though SmoothStreamingMediaElement isn't using that value for BufferingTime. Also, re-buffering causes SmoothStreamingMediaElement to update the BufferingTime value internally, making it unavailable to a Get operation.
- Clips from one or more client manifests that are combined into a composite manifest must have identical audio tracks.

**IIS Smooth Streaming Client 1.5**

- Smooth Streaming Client 1.5 supports IIS Media Services low latency for live Smooth Streams. (This is supported on desktop Silverlight only. It's not supported on Windows Phone.) Low-latency live streaming scenarios require that the Smooth Streaming client connect to a publishing point on a web server that's running at least IIS Media Services 4.0. Earlier versions of IIS Media Services don't support low-latency live streaming. For more information about how to configure low-latency live Smooth Streaming, see [BufferingTime](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.bufferingtime(VS.90).aspx).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Audio-only streams aren't supported in low-latency live streaming scenarios.

**IIS Smooth Streaming Client 1.1**

- Markers don't fire in trickplay modes. Use [Microsoft Media Platform: Player Framework (MMPPF)](http://smf.codeplex.com/) markers if markers are required in fast-forward, rewind or slow-motion modes.
- The Client treats URIs as case-insensitive, which can cause issues on some servers. Use lowercase manifest/stream URIs to avoid any issues.
- Protected streams aren't supported in composite manifests.
- Audio, video, and textstream fragments in a live Smooth Stream must have the same duration.
- For live Smooth Streams, network requests for metadata might continue after calling the [Stop](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.stop(VS.90).aspx) method. To avoid this issue, set the [Source](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.source(VS.90).aspx) property to **Null**.
- To recover from a [MediaFailed](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.mediafailed(VS.90).aspx) event, set the Source property to **Null**, and then wait for a period of time before resetting the source to reconnect.
- The [PlaybackRate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.playbackrate(VS.90).aspx) property must be set to **1.0** before calling the [ScheduleClip](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.web.media.smoothstreaming.smoothstreamingmediaelement.scheduleclip(VS.90).aspx) method. After the clip finishes, you can change the PlaybackRate property back to the desired value.
