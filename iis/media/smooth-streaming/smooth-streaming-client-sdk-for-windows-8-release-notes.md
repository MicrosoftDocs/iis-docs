Smooth Streaming Client SDK for Windows 8 - Release Notes
====================
by [Cenk Dingiloglu](https://github.com/cenkdin)

The Smooth Streaming Client SDK for Windows 8 Apps enables developers to build Windows 8 applications that can play on-demand and live Smooth Streaming content with or without Microsoft PlayReady protection. This document describes the important known issues that occur in this release of the SDK.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - Unless otherwise specified, these Release Notes apply to x64, x86, and ARM editions of the SDK.
> - This build was tested with the Windows 8 RTM and Visual Studio 2012 RTM releases. Unexpected results might occur if you run the SDK on different versions of this software.

## Supported Features

This release of the SDK includes support for the following:

- X86, x64, and ARM platform support
- VOD (Play, Pause, Seek, Stop)
- Live (Play)
- Live DVR (Pause, Seek, Go to Live) \*\*
- Support for video codecs – H.264, VC-1
- Support for Audio codecs – AAC, Dolby DD+, WMA Pro
- Multiple audio language switching with APIs \*\*
- Track-selection for playback (for example, restrict the available bitrates)\*\*
- Offline playback scenarios via Downloader Plugin \*\*
- Text and Sparse Track APIs \*\*
- Content protection – Microsoft PlayReady integration for VC-1/WMA - H.264/AAC content
- Trickplay (slow motion, fast-forward, and rewind)
- Microsoft PlayReady Key rotation
- Multiple Smooth Streaming asset playback.(Such as; Picture in Picture - PIP, Multi-Camera and Video wall) \* Please see known issues section for limitations.

(\*\*) These features aren't supported with Windows 8 default APIs. To enable these features, you need to use Smooth Streaming Client SDK APIs.

## Known Issues

- There is a known issue where on demand content beginning with non-zero offset time doesn't support seeking with default HTML5 controls. It is recommended to use the SDK APIs to paint the control bar and support seeking.
- Live content with the VC-1 codec might hang when seeking.
- Trickplay on ARM platforms have some known issues where the playback rate isn't honored and playback still continues on x1.
- The performance and the count of play backing multiple Smooth Streaming assets at the same time will vary depending on your hardware performance (CPU/GPU) and available bandwidth. For better results it is recommended to restrict/select qualities based on your window size.
- When you navigate from a Smooth Streaming application, Windows will suspend the application. This might cause unexpected behavior. To overcome this, have the application listen to the Suspend/Resume event and call (Pause)/(Play) accordingly.
- On Windows 8 apps, screen saver isn't disabled automatically when there is video playback, This might cause issues. To avoid this, disable the screen saver for Smooth Streaming applications by using [DisplayRequest.RequestActive](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.system.display.displayrequest.requestactive.aspx).
- You must change the build platform from **Any Cpu** to the targeted architecture (x64/x86/ARM) before compiling the project in Visual Studio. Otherwise, you might get compilation errors and warnings such as the following:  
    ![](smooth-streaming-client-sdk-for-windows-8-release-notes/_static/image1.png)  
  
 Leaving the **Any CPU** option selected will display the following warning in the References section in Visual Studio:  
    ![](smooth-streaming-client-sdk-for-windows-8-release-notes/_static/image2.png)
- The SDK depends on the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Package. Failing to add this dependency to the project references will cause Visual Studio to generate compilation errors and warnings, such as the following:  
    ![](smooth-streaming-client-sdk-for-windows-8-release-notes/_static/image3.png)
- To support PlayReady-protected content playback, build version 1678 or later of the Microsoft PlayReady Client SDK for Windows 8 Apps is required.

## Building Player Applications

When you develop your Smooth Streaming player application, we encourage you to use the latest version of the [Microsoft Media Platform Player Framework for Windows 8](http://playerframework.codeplex.com/). If you don't want to use the Player Framework, see [How to build your first HTML5 Windows 8 Smooth Streaming Application](https://blogs.iis.net/cenkd/archive/2012/03/28/How-to-build-your-first-html5-metro-style-smooth-streaming-player.aspx), [A Simple Windows 8 Smooth Streaming Media Player](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Smooth-Streaming-Client-0bb1471f) and [How to build a Smooth Streaming Windows 8 JavaScript application with advanced features](https://blogs.iis.net/cenkd/archive/2012/08/09/how-to-build-a-smooth-streaming-windows-8-javascript-application-with-advanced-features.aspx) to learn how to build a basic HTML5 Smooth Streaming Player using this SDK.
