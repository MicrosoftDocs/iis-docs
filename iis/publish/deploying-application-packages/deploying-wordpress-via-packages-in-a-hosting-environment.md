## Requirements

Environment Requirements:

- Windows Server 2008 R2 or greater
- IIS 7.0 or greater
- Web Deploy 2.0

Application Requirements:

- PHP 5.2
- MySQL 5.1
- Windows Cache 1.1 for PHP

For information about how to install the necessary components, see Step 1. Set Up Your Servers for Hosting.

<a id="_Ref281465807"></a>

## Procedure

This procedure describes how to install WordPress using IIS with Web Deploy. IIS Web Deploy makes installing sites simple and extremely flexible for Hosting Service Provider by allowing them to create deployment packages that include the site, its content, and its database. The package can then be deployed by importing it into IIS via the console or a script. For more information about Web Deploy, refer to the link: [*Web Deploy 2.0: The Official Microsoft IIS Site*](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/web-deploy).

This procedure requires 3 basic steps:

Step 1. Set Up Your Servers for Hosting  
Step 2. Create an Application Package for Deployment  
Step 3. Deploy a Customer Site using IIS with Web Deploy <a id="_Ref279656383"></a>

### Step 1. Set Up Your Servers for Hosting

<a id="_Ref279656387"></a>

#### Overview

This step describes the server components that are required to support deployment of install packages via Web Deploy.

#### Prerequisites

While it is possible to run a web server and database server on the same machine, it is not recommended due to performance and security reasons. We recommend that you use two separate machines running Windows Server 2008 R2: one acting as the Web server and one acting as the database server.

> [!NOTE]
> Both machines must be connected to the Internet to download the required server components.

To simplify installation of the Web server components, installing Web Platform Installer (Web PI) on both machines is highly recommended. Web PI is a tool that automates the installation of a vast majority of server components and other products for Microsoft's Web Platform.

#### Install Web Server Components on Your Web Server and Database Server

To install the required components on your Web server and database server using Web PI 3.0, visit the link: [Install Spotlight Components plus PHP/MySQL related components using Web PI](https://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/install.aspx?appid=IIS7;NETFramework35;NETFramework4;ASPNET;MVC;WDeploy;FTPServer;MediaServices3;ManagementService;CGI;URLRewrite2;SMO;PHP52;WinCache52_11;MySQLConnector;SQLDriverPHPForIIS "Install Components") and click **Install**, following the onscreen instructions. 

> [!NOTE]
> A complete list of components that are installed by default with Web PI 3.0 is included in the Products Installed by Default using Web PI section of this document. You can also review the list of products before installation begins.

#### Install MySQL on your Database Server

To install MySQL, [click here on this link](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html) to download MySQL 5.1 and complete the steps described in the **Install MySQL on Your Database Server** in this document. **Next Steps:** 

- If the Web Deploy 2.0 component is newly installed, you must configure it to allow delegated deployments. Refer to the link: *[Configure the Web Deploy Component on the Web Server](../../web-hosting/joining-the-web-hosting-gallery/configure-site-for-web-deploy-publishing.md)* for more information.
- After you install and configure the server components, validate your server configuration by following the procedures described at the link: *[Validate Your Server Configuration](../../web-hosting/joining-the-web-hosting-gallery/validate-your-server-configuration.md)*.

    [![](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image14.jpg)](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image13.jpg)
10. Once the Web PI process is complete, you can do one of the following:  

    - Click **Finish** to complete the installation process. If you click Finish to complete the installation process, proceed to step C. Enable Permalinks (Optional) to continue creating an application package for deployment.
    - Click **Launch WordPress** to launch your WordPress application. If you click Launch WordPress, the WordPress application page appears:  
        [![](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image16.jpg)](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image15.jpg)

For information about setting up your WordPress site, refer to the link: [WordPress documentation Web page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page "WordPress documentation Web page").

<a id="_Ref283803032"></a>

#### C. Enable Permalinks (Optional)

To enable permalinks (search engine friendly URLs) in WordPress, complete these steps:

1. Log in to WordPress with Administrator user rights.
2. In WordPress, click the **Options** tab.
3. On the Options page, click the **Permalinks** tab.  
   This step takes you to the page from which you can customize how WordPress generates permalinks for blog posts.
4. On the Permalinks page, select **Custom, specify below**, and enter the following string in the **Custom structure** text box:  
   "/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/"
5. Click **Update Permalink Structure**. All the blog post links have URLs that follow the format that you have specified; however, if you click any one of those links, the Web server returns a *404 - File Not Found* error. This error occurs because WordPress relies on a URL rewriting capability within the server to rewrite requests that include "pretty permalinks" to an Index.php file. In the next step, you create a rule that provides this capability.
6. Create a rewrite rule. Open the Web.config file that is located in the WordPress install directory, and paste the following XML section into the system.webServer element:  

    [!code-xml[Main](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/samples/sample1.xml)]

   This rule attempts to match any requested URL. If the URL does not correspond to a file or a folder on the file system, it rewrites the URL to the Index.php file. At that point, WordPress determines which content to serve based on the REQUEST\_URI server variable that contains the original URL before it was modified by this rule.

<a id="_Ref279493252"></a>

#### D. Export the Package from the IIS Application Web Site

1. Open IIS Manager. The Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager application opens.  
    [![](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image18.jpg)](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image17.jpg)

13. Click **Finish**. Use this application package to deploy to customer Web sites as described in Step 3. Deploy a Customer Site using IIS with Web Deploy.

<a id="_Ref279680466"></a>

### Step 3. Deploy a Customer Site using IIS with Web Deploy

#### Overview

When deploying a customer site, most Hosting Service Providers use a control panel that allows them to capture the information required for deployment. This information can then be passed to scripts that create the user, configure the site for hosting, create a database, and import the application package. Here are the basic steps required to deploy a customer site:

1. Create a Customer Application Web Site
2. Create a Customer Application Database
3. Import the Application Package using a CLI Command or PowerShell Script

<a id="_Ref281465620"></a>

#### A. Create a Customer Application Web Site

To create a customer application Web site, complete the steps described in A. Create an IIS Web Site for this Application.<a id="_Ref281465621"></a>

**Tips:** 

- When you create the Web site in IIS, give your application a user-friendly name by creating a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the host header and adding that FQDN to your Domain Name Service.
- You can automate this process using a script similar to the one described in the section Automated Deployment Script.

#### B. Create a Customer Application Database

To create a customer application database, complete these steps:

1. Open a command-line prompt (or MySQL Manager) at the MySQL bin directory. If you used the default installation path, the bin directory path will be similar to the following: `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\bin`
2. Enter the administrator password, and press **Enter**.
3. Type the following command to create the database, and press **Enter**.  
 mysql&gt; create database wordpress01;
4. Type this command to create a user, and press **Enter**.  
 mysql&gt; create user ‘wordpressuser'@'localhost' identified by ‘pass@word1';
5. Type this command to grant permissions, and press **Enter**.  
 mysql&gt; grant all on wordpress01. \* to ‘wordpress01'@'localhost';

Your command window should appear similar to the following:  
  
[![](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image42.jpg)](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image41.jpg)

> [!TIP]
> You can automate this process using a script similar to the one described in the section MySQL Database Creation Script.

<a id="_Ref280187335"></a>

#### C. Import the Application Package using a CLI Command or PowerShell Script

Once you export the application package (as described in Step 2. Create an Application Package for Deployment), you can easily import the package into the customer site using the CLI command or PowerShell script listed below. These methods allow you to add the parameters that are required to configure an application for use.

The examples in this topic show how to import WordPress into an IIS Web site and install the application database. This package is configured to allow two parameters: one for the IIS site name and one for the database connection string.

##### *CLI Command*

[!code-powershell[Main](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/samples/sample5.ps1)]

<a id="_Install_MySQL_on"></a>

#### Install MySQL on your Database Server

1. Download the latest stable version of MySQL from the [official website](http://www.mysql.com/) and run the installer on a dedicated database server. The MySQL Server Instance Configuration Wizard appears.  
    [![](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image44.jpg)](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image43.jpg)
2. Click the **Dedicated MySQL Server Machine** option button, and click **Next**.[![](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image46.jpg)](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image45.jpg)
3. Click **Next**.[![](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image48.jpg)](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image47.jpg)
4. For concurrent connections, click the **Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)** option button (since this option reflects the workload of a typical shared hosting database server), and then click **Next**.  
    [![](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image50.jpg)](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image49.jpg)
5. Click the **Enable TCP/IP Networking** check box, and then click the **Add firewall exception for this post** check box.
6. Clear the **Enable Strict Mode** check box if it is checked.  
    [![](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image52.jpg)](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image51.jpg)
7. Click the Best Support For Multilingualism option button to enable support for the UTF-8 character set.  
    **IMPORTANT!** You must choose the Best Support for Multilingualism option button since several applications in the Web Application Gallery require UTF-8 support in the database.
8. Click **Next**.  
    [![](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image54.jpg)](deploying-wordpress-via-packages-in-a-hosting-environment/_static/image53.jpg)
9. Click the **Include Bin Directory in Windows PATH** check box, and click **Next**.
10. Since MySQL is installed on the database server (which is different than the Web server that runs the Web Deploy web server component), you must complete these steps to ensure Web Deploy can access the database server:  

    - Copy mysqldump.exe (typically located in `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\bin`) to your **Web server** in `C:\mysqldump\mysqldump.exe`.
    - On the **Web server**, set a registry key (`HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\IIS Extensions\MSDeploy\1\mysqldumppath`) to string value == "c:\mysqldump\mysqldump.exe"

> [!NOTE]
> If you lose the credentials to your MySQL database, refer to the link: [*Resetting the Root Password: Windows Systems*](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/resetting-permissions.html#resetting-permissions-windows) to reset your password.
