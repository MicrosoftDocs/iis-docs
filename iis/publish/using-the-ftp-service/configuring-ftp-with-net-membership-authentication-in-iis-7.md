Configuring FTP with .NET Membership Authentication in IIS 7
====================
by [Robert McMurray](https://github.com/rmcmurray)

## Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| IIS 7.5 | The FTP 7.5 service ships as a feature for IIS 7.5 in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. |
| IIS 7.0 | The FTP 7.0 and FTP 7.5 services were shipped out-of-band for IIS 7.0, which required downloading and installing the service from the following URL: [https://www.iis.net/download/FTP](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/ftp). |

## Introduction

Microsoft has created a new FTP service that has been completely rewritten for Windows ServerÂ® 2008. This new FTP service incorporates many new features that enable web authors to publish content better than before, and offers web administrators more security and deployment options.

This document walks you through configuring your Default Web Site for FTP membership-based authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> This document was written using an instance of SQL server that is installed on the local web server.

### Prerequisites

The following items are required to complete the procedures in this article:

1. IIS 7.0 must be installed on your Windows Server 2008, and the following must be configured: 

    - The Default Web Site that is created by the IIS 7.0 installation must still exist.
    - The Internet Information Services Manager must be installed.
2. The new FTP service must be installed. You can download and install the FTP service from the [https://www.iis.net/](https://www.iis.net/) web site using one of the following links: 

    - [FTP 7.5 for IIS 7.0 (x64)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=143197)
    - [FTP 7.5 for IIS 7.0 (x86)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=143196)
3. Set the content permissions to allow access for the extensibility COM process that handles authentication: 

    - Open a command prompt.
    - Type the following command:

        [!code-console[Main](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/samples/sample1.cmd)]
    - Close the command prompt.

## Adding FTP Publishing to the Default Web Site

In this first section, you add FTP publishing to the Default Web site, and add the required settings to allow the local administrator account to edit the content.

1. In IIS 7.0 Manager, in the **Connections** pane, expand the **Sites** node in the tree, then click the Default Web Site.
2. Click **Add FTP Publishing** in the **Actions** pane.  
     [![](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image3.jpg)](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image1.jpg)
3. When the **Add FTP Site Publishing** wizard appears: 

    - Choose an IP address for your FTP site from the **IP Address** drop-down, or choose to accept the default selection of "All Unassigned." For this walkthrough, enter the local loopback IP address for your computer by typing "127.0.0.1" in the **IP Address** box.
	
	    > [!NOTE]
	    > If you are using IPv6, you should also add the IPv6 localhost binding of "::1".
    - Normally, you would enter the TCP/IP port for the FTP site in the **Port** box. For this walk-through, choose to accept the default port of 21.
    - For this walkthrough, we will not use a host name, so make sure that the **Virtual Host** box is blank.
    - Make sure that the **SSL Certificate** drop-down is set to "Not Selected" and that the **Allow SSL** option is selected.
    - When you have completed these items, click **Next**.

     [![](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image8.jpg)](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image7.jpg)
4. On the next page of the wizard, you will not configure any authentication or authorization settings because these settings will be configured later. Click **Finish** to complete the wizard.  
     [![](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image11.jpg)](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/_static/image9.jpg)

#### Summary

To recap the items that you completed in this section -- we added FTP publishing to the "Default Web Site" by:

- Adding an FTP binding for the Web site for the local loopback IP address on port 21
- Choosing not to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for the FTP site.

> [!NOTE]
> You have not yet enabled any authentication or authorization settings.

## Configuring ASP.NET for Membership Authentication

### Configure your Local SQL Server for ASP.NET Membership

This section describes the basic process for configuring ASP.NET for membership authentication. For detailed information, please see the "Configure ASP.NET for Membership" section in the [How To: Use Forms Authentication with SQL Server in ASP.NET 2.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ms998317.aspx) topic on the MSDN web site.

If you do not have access to an existing SQL Server, you must install SQL Server.

If you do not already have an ASP.NET database created, you need to build the ASP.NET database on the SQL server using the appropriate command from the following list for the version of the framework that you are using:

- **32-bit Framework**: 

    [!code-console[Main](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/samples/sample2.cmd)]
- **64-bit Framework**: 

    [!code-console[Main](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/samples/sample3.cmd)]

> [!NOTE]
> To use a remote SQL server instead of "localhost" as shown in the above example, see the "Deployment Considerations" section in the [How To: Use Forms Authentication with SQL Server in ASP.NET 2.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998317.aspx) topic on the MSDN web site.

Because the COM process for FTP extensibility runs as "NT AUTHORITY\Network Service", you need to add the "NT AUTHORITY\Network Service" account to the ASP.NET database on your SQL Server. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Open the SQL Server Enterprise Manager.
2. Create a SQL Server login for NT AUTHORITY\Network Service.
3. Grant the login access to the Aspnetdb database by creating a database user.
4. Add the database user to the aspnet\_Membership\_FullAccess database role.

### Configure ASP.NET for FTP Membership

The following steps describe the process for configuring ASP.NET to allow membership authentication for FTP access.

1. Using a text editor such as Windows Notepad, open your root web.config file, which should be located at the appropriate path for the version of the framework that you are using: 

    - 32-bit Framework: 

        [!code-console[Main](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/samples/sample4.cmd)]
    - 64-bit Framework: 

        [!code-console[Main](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/samples/sample5.cmd)]
2. Scroll to the bottom and paste the following code before the closing &lt;/configuration&gt; tag: 

    [!code-xml[Main](configuring-ftp-with-net-membership-authentication-in-iis-7/samples/sample6.xml)]
3. Save and close your root web.config file.

#### Summary

You have configured ASP.NET for membership authentication. To recap the items that you completed in this section, we configured your server by:

- Configuring your Local SQL Server for ASP.NET Membership
- Configuring ASP.NET for FTP Membership
