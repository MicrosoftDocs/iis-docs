# Changing authentication mode for a given website

by [Elliott Hamai](https://github.com/ehamai)

## ApphostAuthOverride Provider

This is a new Web Deploy provider which will provide support for changing authentication mode for a given website. Many a times in enterprise environments applications want to choose their own authentication method using web.config file, but AppHostConfig file locks this setting. This means that if a developer tries to set his/her site's authentication settings, IIS will not obey it. The Application Host Authentication Override provider allows developers to configure how IIS locks an authentication setting on the server by adding a `<location>` tag for that setting within the server's applicationHost.config file. Here is an example of what that looks like in config:

[!code-xml[Main](changing-authentication-mode-for-a-given-website/samples/sample1.xml)]

Here is a few command line examples of how this could be done *(msdeploy.exe is located under `%programfiles%\IIS\Microsoft Web Deploy V3`)*:

路 **Allow Windows Authentication on Destination at site = SiteName:**

[!code-console[Main](changing-authentication-mode-for-a-given-website/samples/sample2.cmd)]

路 **Allow ASP.Net Forms Authentication on Destination at site = SiteName:**

[!code-console[Main](changing-authentication-mode-for-a-given-website/samples/sample3.cmd)]

路 **Deny Anonymous Authentication on Destination at site = SiteName:**

[!code-console[Main](changing-authentication-mode-for-a-given-website/samples/sample4.cmd)]

路 **Reset Windows Authentication Setting on Destination at site = SiteName:**

[!code-console[Main](changing-authentication-mode-for-a-given-website/samples/sample5.cmd)]

Please note the syntax carefully, both &lt;sitename" and authentication setting are part of -dest:ApphostAuthOverride value.
