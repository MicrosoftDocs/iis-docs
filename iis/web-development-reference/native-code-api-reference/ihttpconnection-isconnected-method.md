# IHttpConnection::IsConnected Method
Determines whether a Web client is still connected to the current request.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
virtual BOOL IsConnected(  
   VOID  
) const = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 This method takes no parameters.  
  
## Return Value  
 `true` if the Web client is still connected; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `IsConnected` method determines whether a Web client has remained connected to the current request or has disconnected from the current request. For example, if a request is taking a long time to process, a Web client may choose to end the connection. If an HTTP module calls the `IsConnected` method and determines that the connection has been terminated by the client, the module can bypass remaining notifications and end additional request processing by returning [RQ_NOTIFICATION_FINISH_REQUEST](../../web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/request-notification-status-enumeration.md). This frees IIS from continuing to process a request for a disconnected Web client.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to use the [IHttpContext::GetConnection](../../web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/ihttpcontext-getconnection-method.md) method to create an HTTP module that retrieves a pointer to an [IHttpConnection](../../web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/ihttpconnection-interface.md) interface. The example then calls the `IHttpConnection::IsConnected` method to determine whether the Web client that initiated the current request is still connected. If the client is still connected, the HTTP module will return a status message to the Web client. If the client is not connected, the module will return `RQ_NOTIFICATION_FINISH_REQUEST` to end additional processing.  
  
 [!code-cpp[IHttpConnectionIsConnected#1](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_IIS/IIS7/IHttpConnectionIsConnected/cpp/IHttpConnectionIsConnected.cpp#1)]  
  
 Your module must export the [RegisterModule](../../web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/pfn-registermodule-function.md) function. You can export this function by creating a module definition (.def) file for your project, or you can compile the module by using the `/EXPORT:RegisterModule` switch. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Request-Level HTTP Module By Using Native Code](../../web-development-reference/native-code-development-overview/walkthrough-creating-a-request-level-http-module-by-using-native-code.md).  
  
 You can optionally compile the code by using the `__stdcall (/Gz)` calling convention instead of explicitly declaring the calling convention for each function.
