# IHttpContext::MapPath Method
Returns the physical path of a relative URL.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
virtual HRESULT MapPath(  
   PCWSTR pszUrl,  
   __out_bcount(* pcbPhysicalPath) PWSTR pszPhysicalPath,  
   DWORD* pcbPhysicalPath  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `pszUrl`  
 [IN] A pointer to a string that contains the relative URL to map.  
  
 `pszPhysicalPath`  
 [OUT] A pointer to a string that receives the mapped path.  
  
 `pcbPhysicalPath`  
 [IN] A pointer to a `DWORD` that contains the size of the buffer pointed to by `pszPhysicalPath`.  
  
## Return Value  
 An `HRESULT`. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|Indicates that the operation was successful.|  
|ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER|Indicates that the buffer pointed to by `pszPhysicalPath` is not large enough to perform the operation.|  
|ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY|Indicates that there is insufficient memory to perform the operation.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `MapPath` method returns the physical location of the relative URL that is contained in the `pszUrl` parameter.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the buffer pointed to by the `pszPhysicalPath` parameter is not large enough to perform the operation, the `pcbPhysicalPath``DWORD` parameter will contain the required buffer size for the operation.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to use the `MapPath` method to create an HTTP module that returns the physical path of the root folder for the Web site that uses this module.  
  
<!-- TODO: review snippet reference  [!CODE [IHttpContextMapPath#1](IHttpContextMapPath#1)]  -->  
  
 Your module must export the [RegisterModule](../../web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/pfn-registermodule-function.md) function. You can export this function by creating a module definition (.def) file for your project, or you can compile the module by using the `/EXPORT:RegisterModule` switch. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Request-Level HTTP Module By Using Native Code](../../web-development-reference/native-code-development-overview/walkthrough-creating-a-request-level-http-module-by-using-native-code.md).  
  
 You can compile the code by using the `__stdcall (/Gz)` calling convention instead of explicitly declaring the calling convention for each function.
