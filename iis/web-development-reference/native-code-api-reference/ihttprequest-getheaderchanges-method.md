# IHttpRequest::GetHeaderChanges Method
Retrieves the changes to the server headers for the current request.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
virtual HRESULT GetHeaderChanges(  
   IN DWORD dwOldChangeNumber,  
   OUT DWORD* pdwNewChangeNumber,  
   IN OUT PCSTR knownHeaderSnapshot [HttpHeaderRequestMaximum],  
   IN OUT DWORD* pdwUnknownHeaderSnapShot,  
   IN OUT PCSTR** ppUnknownHeaderNameSnapShot,  
   IN OUT PCSTR** ppUnknownHeaderValueSnapShot,  
   __out_ecount(HttpHeaderRequestMaximum+1) DWORD diffedKnownHeaderIndices [HttpHeaderRequestMaximum+1],  
   OUT DWORD* pdwDiffedUnknownHeaders,  
   OUT DWORD** ppDiffedUnknownHeaderIndices  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `dwOldChangeNumber`  
 [IN] A `DWORD` that contains the old change number.  
  
 `pdwNewChangeNumber`  
 [OUT] A pointer to a `DWORD` that contains the new change number.  
  
 `knownHeaderSnapshot`  
 [IN][OUT] A pointer to a string array that contains the snapshot of all known headers. (The array will contain the new headers when calling, and it will contain the old headers when returning.)  
  
 `pdwUnknownHeaderSnapShot`  
 [IN][OUT] A pointer to a `DWORD` that contains the number of unknown headers in the snapshot.  
  
 `ppUnknownHeaderNameSnapShot`  
 [IN][OUT] A pointer to the address of a string array that contains the names of all unknown headers. (The array will contain the new headers when calling, and it will contain the old headers when returning.)  
  
 `ppUnknownHeaderValueSnapShot`  
 [IN][OUT] A pointer to the address of a string array that contains a list of all header values in the snapshot.  
  
 `diffedKnownHeaderIndices`  
 [OUT] An array of `DWORD` values, terminated by a –1 value, that contain the indexes of headers that have changed in the list of known headers.  
  
 `pdwDiffedUnknownHeaders`  
 [OUT] A pointer to a `DWORD` value that contains number of unknown headers that have changed.  
  
 `ppDiffedUnknownHeaderIndices`  
 [OUT] A pointer to the address of an array of `DWORD` values, terminated by a –1 value, that contain the indexes of headers that have changed in the list of unknown headers.  
  
## Return Value  
 An `HRESULT`. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|Indicates that the operation was successful.|  
|ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY|Indicates that there is insufficient memory to perform the operation.|  
  
## Remarks  
 IIS uses the `GetHeaderChanges` method to test for changes to the HTTP headers since the last time the headers were examined.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  IIS uses the `GetHeaderChanges` method to internally synchronize the headers between calls to native and managed code. You should not use the `GetHeaderChanges` method when you create an HTTP module.
