# IHttpServer::IsCommandLineLaunch Method
Tests whether the worker process was launched from the command line.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
virtual BOOL IsCommandLineLaunch(  
   VOID  
) const = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 This method takes no parameters.  
  
## Return Value  
 `true` if [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../wmi-provider/includes/iisver-md.md)] was launched from a command line; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `IsCommandLineLaunch` method retrieves the startup status for a worker process. For example, if a worker process is started by a normal HTTP request for a Web site that is hosted by [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../wmi-provider/includes/iisver-md.md)], `IsCommandLineLaunch` will return `true`. In contrast, if a worker process is started by the [Hosted Web Core](../../web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/hosted-web-core-api-reference.md), `IsCommandLineLaunch` will return `false`.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to create an HTTP module that uses the `IsCommandLineLaunch` method to test whether the worker process was launched from a command line. The module then returns this information to a Web client.  
  
 [!code-cpp[IHttpServerIsCommandLineLaunch#1](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_IIS/IIS7/IHttpServerIsCommandLineLaunch/cpp/IHttpServerIsCommandLineLaunch.cpp#1)]  
  
 Your module must export the [RegisterModule](../../web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/pfn-registermodule-function.md) function. You can export this function by creating a module definition (.def) file for your project, or you can compile the module by using the `/EXPORT:RegisterModule` switch. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Request-Level HTTP Module By Using Native Code](../../web-development-reference/native-code-development-overview/walkthrough-creating-a-request-level-http-module-by-using-native-code.md).  
  
 You can optionally compile the code by using the `__stdcall (/Gz)` calling convention instead of explicitly declaring the calling convention for each function.
