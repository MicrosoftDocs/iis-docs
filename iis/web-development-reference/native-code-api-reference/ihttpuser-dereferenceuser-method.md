# IHttpUser::DereferenceUser Method
Decrements the user internal reference count.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
virtual VOID DereferenceUser(  
   VOID  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 This method takes no parameters.  
  
## Thread Safety  
 Classes that implement the [IHttpUser](../../web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/ihttpuser-interface.md) interface are thread safe for the [ReferenceUser](../../web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/ihttpuser-referenceuser-method.md) and `DereferenceUser` methods.  
  
## Remarks  
 Classes that implement the `IHttpUser` interface use reference counting that is thread safe for memory management. When an `IHttpUser` pointer is constructed, the internal reference count (a `private` member variable) is set to 1. When the `ReferenceUser` method is called, this reference count is incremented by 1. When the `DereferenceUser` method is called, this same reference count is decremented by 1. Only when the reference count goes to 0 is the `IHttpUser` interface removed from the heap. This scheme guarantees that the `IHttpUser` pointer will not be deleted until the last client of that pointer calls the `DereferenceUser` method.  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 The `ReferenceUser` and `DereferenceUser` method implementations should be thread safe for an `IHttpUser` pointer. Implementers should provide only private or protected destructors that are called only when the reference count goes to 0.  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 Clients should never attempt to cast an `IHttpUser` interface to a more specific class and then call `delete` directly; clients should instead call the `ReferenceUser` method exactly once when a pointer to an `IHttpUser` interface is retrieved, and then call the `DereferenceUser` method when the `IHttpUser` interface will no longer be accessed. You should call the `ReferenceUser` and `DereferenceUser` methods as early and as late as possible, respectively, to guarantee that an `IHttpUser` pointer will be valid on the heap when it is accessed and deleted when it is no longer needed.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates a class called `MyHttpUser` that implements the `IHttpUser` interface.  
  
```  
// Create a class that implements the IHttpUser interface.  
class MyHttpUser : public IHttpUser  
{  
public:  
    // Create a public constructor.  
    // Set the internal reference count to 1.  
    MyHttpUser()  
    {  
        m_cRefs = 1;  
    }  
  
    // Increment the internal reference count.  
    virtual VOID ReferenceUser(VOID)  
    {  
        InterlockedIncrement(&m_cRefs);  
    }  
  
    // Decrement the internal reference count.  
    virtual VOID DereferenceUser(VOID)  
    {  
        // Decrement the reference count and call delete this  
        // if the count is 0.  
        if (0 == InterlockedDecrement(&m_cRefs))  
        {  
            delete this;  
        }  
    }  
  
private:  
    // Create a private destructor called from DereferenceUser.  
    virtual ~MyHttpUser()  
    {  
  
    }  
  
    //Private reference count member.  
    LONG m_cRefs;  
}  
```
