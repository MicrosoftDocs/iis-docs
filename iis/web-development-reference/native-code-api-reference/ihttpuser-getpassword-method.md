# IHttpUser::GetPassword Method
Returns the user password.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
virtual PCWSTR GetPassword(  
   VOID  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 This method takes no parameters.  
  
## Return Value  
 A pointer to a constant null-terminated Unicode string that contains the user password.  
  
## Remarks  
 The value returned depends on the authentication type. The authentication type is returned from the [GetAuthenticationType](../../web-development-reference\native-code-api-reference/ihttpuser-getauthenticationtype-method.md) method.  
  
 The following table shows authentication types with the associated password values.  
  
|Authentication type|Password value|  
|-------------------------|--------------------|  
|Active Directory|Encrypted hash|  
|Anonymous|Empty string|  
|Basic|Unencrypted plaintext|  
|Digest|MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) hash|  
|Forms|Unencrypted plaintext or encryption using SHA1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) or MD5|  
|Windows|Empty string|  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  An unencrypted password should never be displayed or returned to the user. Consider using an authentication scheme other than Basic, because Basic passes both the user name and password in plaintext form.  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 [IHttpUser](../../web-development-reference\native-code-api-reference/ihttpuser-interface.md) implementers are responsible for memory management with this data; therefore, `IHttpUser` implementers that use dynamic memory allocation must release or call `delete` on the `PCWSTR` pointer when it is no longer needed.  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 `IHttpUser` implementers are responsible for memory management with this data; therefore, `IHttpUser` clients must not release or call `delete` on the returned `PCWSTR` pointer when this data is no longer needed. Furthermore, clients must not cast this data to a pointer that is not a `const` or change the state of the memory referenced by this `PCWSTR`; otherwise, an access violation will be thrown or the data will become invalid.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to create an HTTP module that clears the response headers and body and then returns user information to the client as an XML document.  
  
<!-- TODO: review snippet reference  [!CODE [IHttpUser#4](IHttpUser#4)]  -->  
  
 The above code writes XML that is similar to the following to the response stream.  
  
```  
<?xml version="1.0" ?>  
<user passWord="[hidden]" />  
```  
  
 Your module must export the [RegisterModule](../../web-development-reference\native-code-api-reference/pfn-registermodule-function.md) function. You can export this function by creating a module definition (.def) file for your project, or you can compile the module by using the `/EXPORT:RegisterModule` switch. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Request-Level HTTP Module By Using Native Code](../../web-development-reference\native-code-development-overview\walkthrough-creating-a-request-level-http-module-by-using-native-code.md).  
  
 You can optionally compile the code by using the `__stdcall (/Gz)` calling convention instead of explicitly declaring the calling convention for each function.
