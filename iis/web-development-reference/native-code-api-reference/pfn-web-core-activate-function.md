# PFN_WEB_CORE_ACTIVATE Function
Starts an instance of the Hosted Web Core.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef HRESULT (*PFN_WEB_CORE_ACTIVATE)(  
   IN PCWSTR pszAppHostConfigFile,  
   IN PCWSTR pszRootWebConfigFile,  
   IN PCWSTR pszInstanceName  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `pszAppHostConfigFile`  
 A pointer to a string that contains the path of a configuration file.  
  
 `pszRootWebConfigFile`  
 A pointer to a string that contains the path of a root Web.config file. (Optional)  
  
 `pszInstanceName`  
 A pointer to a string that contains the name of the instance that will be used for event logging.  
  
## Return Value  
 An `HRESULT`. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|Indicates that the operation was successful.|  
|ERROR_SERVICE_ALREADY_RUNNING|Indicates that an instance of the Hosted Web Core is already running in the process.|  
|ERROR_INVALID_DATA|Indicates that a configuration error occurred in the configuration file.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the `PFN_WEB_CORE_ACTIVATE` function returns an ERROR_INVALID_DATA message, the Event Viewer may contain additional details regarding the cause of the failure.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `PFN_WEB_CORE_ACTIVATE` function is a prototype for the `WebCoreActivate` DLL entry point in Hwebcore.dll that is used to start the Hosted Web Core. The process that hosts the Web core is required to provide the path of a configuration file that contains the configuration settings for any sites, the application pool, and so on, that are to be created.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The Hosted Web Core requires a configuration file that follows the design of the ApplicationHost.config file, except that Hosted Web Core supports only one application pool. For more information about how to create a configuration file for your application, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Configuration File for Hosted Web Core](../../web-development-reference/native-code-development-overview/walkthrough-creating-a-configuration-file-for-hosted-web-core.md).  
  
 This function also requires the name of the instance of the Hosted Web Core that [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../wmi-provider/includes/iisver-md.md)] uses when it logs events to the Event Viewer. The hosting process may optionally provide the path of a root Web.config file that contains any additional parameters.
