# PFN\_WEBHOST\_LISTENER\_APPLICATION\_POOL\_CAN\_OPEN\_NEW\_LISTENER\_CHANNEL\_INSTANCE Function

Â 

Notifies the listener adapter that it is possible to launch other instances of this listener channel.

## Syntax

```cpp
typedef VOID(* PFN_WEBHOST_LISTENER_APPLICATION_POOL_CAN_OPEN_NEW_LISTENER_CHANNEL_INSTANCE)(  
   IN VOID* pContext,  
   IN LPCWSTR AppPoolId,  
   IN DWORD ListenerChannelId  
);  
```

### Parameters

`pContext`  
\[IN\] A pointer to a `VOID` context that the listener adapter passed to [WebhostRegisterProtocol](webhostregisterprotocol-function.md).

`AppPoolId`  
\[IN\] A pointer to a string that contains the application pool to which the listener adapter belongs.

`ListenerChannelId`  
\[IN\] A `DWORD` that contains the listener channel ID.

## Return Value

`VOID`.

## Remarks

The listener adapter should call the [WebhostOpenListenerChannelInstance](webhostopenlistenerchannelinstance-function.md) function to open the initial listener channel when it receives the first request. The listener adapter should not call `WebhostOpenListenerChannelInstance` again until it is notified through this function.

This notification can be called whenever a new instance of a listener channel can be connected to a worker process. The following are some of the situations in which this notification may occur:

  - A Web garden contains processes that can either be launched or that are not currently running the processing code for this listener channel.

  - A worker process has idled out and a new one can be launched.

  - A non-overlap recycle process has occurred and a new worker process can be launched.

  - A worker process has terminated unexpectedly and a new one can be launched.

  - The application domain the listener channel was connected to has idled out.

  - The application domain was shut down (for any reason); therefore, the listener channel was stopped and can now be restarted.

The Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) calls this function asynchronously and does not wait for the completion of the notification.
