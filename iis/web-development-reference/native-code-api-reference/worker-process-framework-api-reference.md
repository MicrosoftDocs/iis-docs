# Worker Process Framework API Reference
The worker process framework allows protocol managers to retrieve configuration information about a worker process, and it allows worker processes to retrieve the listener-related health information from a protocol manager. The worker process framework is a set of protocol-independent interfaces that enable worker processes and protocol managers to exchange data with other protocol managers. Protocol managers are responsible for starting and stopping listener channels for a protocol and for gathering health-related information.
