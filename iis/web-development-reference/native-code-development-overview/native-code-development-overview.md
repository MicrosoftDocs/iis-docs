# Native-Code Development Overview
IIS 7 and IIS 8 enable native-code developers to extend the Web server in a variety of new and powerful ways. For example, with the request-processing of IIS, native-code developers can create HTTP modules by using a rich set of APIs and a class-based configuration and notification infrastructure. With previous versions of IIS, such as IIS 6.0, developers could create HTTP modules by using only managed-code, and HTTP modules would process only [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../wmi-provider/includes/vstecasp-md.md)] requests. With IIS 7 and IIS 8, developers can now create HTTP modules by using C++, and these modules can process all Web requests, not just [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../wmi-provider/includes/vstecasp-md.md)] requests.
