# Microsoft Web Platform Installer 2.0

by [Walter Oliver](https://github.com/walterov)

## Introduction

The [Web Platform Installer 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx) (WPI) is a tool that installs Microsoft's entire Web Platform, including IIS, Visual Web Developer 2010 Express Edition, SQL Server 2008 R2 Express Edition and the .NET 4 Framework. Using the Web Platform Installer's user interface, you can choose to install either specific products or the entire Microsoft Web Platform onto your computer. The Web PI also helps keep your products up to date by always offering the latest additions to the Web Platform.
