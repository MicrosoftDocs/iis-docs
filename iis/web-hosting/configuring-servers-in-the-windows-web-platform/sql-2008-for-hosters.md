SQL 2008 for Hosters
====================
by [Walter Oliver](https://github.com/walterov)

## Introduction

The purpose of this article is to provide information about deploying and optimizing SQL Server 2008 for shared and dedicated hosting environments. It provides links to videos and documents that cover best practices for deployment, configuration, management, security, programmability, tenant isolation, and performance optimization of a hosted SQL Server 2008 deployment. It constitutes a complete map of guidance and detailed information, including references to SQL Server architecture information and sample scripts for provisioning users and databases in shared hosting scenarios. It emphasizes detailed descriptions of the new features that make SQL Server an ideal database platform for the Web.

Notice that Microsoft has produced a set of SQL Server SKUs targeted for various scenarios, including Web Application Hosting. Here is the SKU feature comparison table:
