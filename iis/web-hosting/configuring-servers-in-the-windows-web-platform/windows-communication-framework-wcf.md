Windows Communication Framework (WCF)
====================
by [Walter Oliver](https://github.com/walterov)

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a feature of Windows Server® 2008.

It can be activated by using the Server Manager's "Add Features Wizard". The Server Manager is a Microsoft Management Console plug-in found in the Control Panel. Use WCF as part of the Application Server Role for deployment of a Web Services application.

The following dialog shows the "Add Feature Wizard" dialog in Server Manager used to activate WCF. See the highlighted item.
