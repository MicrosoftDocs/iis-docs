Sales and Marketing Questions
====================
by [Walter Oliver](https://github.com/walterov)

#### Why should customers migrate from IIS 6.0 to IIS 7.0?

- Modular pipeline. Tight integration with ASP.NET. Better shared hosting performance. Better administration tools. Simpler diagnostics.
- Inexpensive, streamlined Windows Server Web Edition, perfect for hosting workloads
- Scalable shared hosting - easily sandbox up to 4000 Web sites on a single server
- World-class performance and reliability hosting of ASP, ASP.NET, and PHP applications
- Remote Web site administration tool for site owners and developers supporting Vista®, Windows® 2003 and XP®
- In-depth runtime state data providing detailed diagnostic information
- Modern FTP publishing support, including integrated Web publishing, FTP/SSL, and membership-based authentication.

#### What are the differences between Windows Server® 2008 Web Edition and Standard Edition? Will the Web edition still have limitations on number of RPC connections?

This has not yet been finalized.

#### Is the SPLA pricing on the Web version of Windows Server 2008 going to be more or less expensive than Server 2003 Web?

This has not yet been finalized.

#### What is Windows Server 2008 "ServerCore"? Will IIS 7.0 run on ServerCore, and will it have any limitations compared to Web, Standard, and Enterprise?

ServerCore is a minimal install of Windows: no UI, no media, nothing. If IIS 7.0 does work on it, it will have serious limitations: e.g., no managed code on server core, lots of random DLLs will not be there and you have to know how to do everything from the command line.
