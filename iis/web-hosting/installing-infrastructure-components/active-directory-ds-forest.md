Active Directory DS Forest
====================
by [Walter Oliver](https://github.com/walterov)

## Introduction

A Windows Deployment Services server must be either a member of an Active Directory Domain Services domain or a domain controller for an Active Directory Domain Services domain. The Active Directory Domain Services domain and forest versions are irrelevant; all domain and forest configurations support Windows Deployment Services.

## Installation Methods

When installing Active Directory Domain Services Forest on a machine that already is running Windows ServerÂ® 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2, use any of the following methods:

- [Installing a New Windows Server 2008 Forest by Using the Windows Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc755059(v=ws.10))
- [Installing a New Windows Server 2008 Forest by Using the Command Line](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731449(v%3dws.10))
- [Installing a New Windows Server 2008 Forest by Using an Answer File](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc770303(v%3dws.10))

For detailed Step-by-step guidance on installing Active Directory for all the Directory Services (Forest, Child Domain, and Domain Tree), refer to [Steps for Installing AD DS](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-r2-and-2008/cc754438(v%3dws.10)) in all configurations, including instructions for installing it on a full installation or a Server Core installation of Windows Server 2008 R2. It provides the Windows interface, command-line, and answer file methods for performing installations.

The process for performing an unattended installation of AD DS is the same for a server that is running a full installation of Windows Server 2008 R2 or a Server Core installation. The unattended method of installation is required for a Server Core installation.
