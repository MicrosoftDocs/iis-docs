Overview: Build a Web Farm with IIS Servers
====================
by Keith Newman and Robert McMurray

This document contains an overview of the **Build a web farm with IIS servers** scenario. It also contains links to additional information and community resources related to the scenario.

## Scenario Description

This scenario shows how to plan and configure a web farm with servers that run the Windows Server® 2012 operating system.

The scenario is divided into two phases: a plan and design phase, and an install and configure phase. In the plan and design phase, you learn what the concepts needed to configure a web farm that keeps its server configuration and content synchronized, balances server load, and stores SSL certificate centrally. In the install and configure phase, you are guided through the procedures required to install IIS web server, configure a back-end content server, configure load balancing, and configure a central certificate store for SSL.

## In This Scenario

- [Plan a Web Farm with IIS Servers](plan-a-web-farm-with-iis-servers.md)

    - [Step 1: Plan IIS Web Farm Infrastructure](planning-step-1-plan-iis-web-farm-infrastructure.md)
    - [Step 2: Plan IIS Web Farm Configuration](planning-step-2-plan-iis-web-farm-configuration.md)
    - [Step 3: Plan IIS Web Farm Load Balancing](planning-step-3-plan-iis-web-farm-load-balancing.md)
    - [Step 4: Plan SSL Central Certificate Store](planning-step-4-plan-ssl-central-certificate-store.md)
    - [Step 5: Plan Application Deployment](planning-step-5-plan-application-deployment.md)
- [Configure a Web Farm with IIS Servers](configure-a-web-farm-with-iis-servers.md)

    - [Step 1: Install IIS Web Farm Infrastructure](configuring-step-1-install-iis-web-farm-infrastructure.md)
    - [Step 2: Configure IIS Web Farm Servers](configuring-step-2-configure-iis-web-farm-servers.md)
    - [Step 3: Configure IIS Web Farm Load Balancing](configuring-step-3-configure-iis-web-farm-load-balancing.md)
    - [Step 4: Configure SSL Central Certificate Store](configuring-step-4-configure-ssl-central-certificate-store.md)
    - [Step 5: Configure Application Deployment](configuring-step-5-configure-application-deployment.md)

## Practical Applications

Whether you are an IT professional, a web developer, or you just want to set up your own web farm, this scenario can help you install and configure a fully functional web farm with IIS web servers.

## Software Requirements

To get the most from this scenario, you must have administrator access to at least five computers (or virtual machines) that run the Windows Server 2012 operating system.
