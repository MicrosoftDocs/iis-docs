- [Step 1: Plan IIS Web Farm Infrastructure](planning-step-1-plan-iis-web-farm-infrastructure.md)
- [Step 2: Plan IIS Web Farm Configuration](planning-step-2-plan-iis-web-farm-configuration.md)
- [Step 3: Plan IIS Web Farm Load Balancing](planning-step-3-plan-iis-web-farm-load-balancing.md)
- [Step 4: Plan SSL Central Certificate Store](planning-step-4-plan-ssl-central-certificate-store.md)

For planning information you should review before deployment, see  Plan a Web Farm with IIS Servers. For more information, see [Build a Web Farm with IIS Servers](overview-build-a-web-farm-with-iis-servers.md).

## Software Requirements

To get the most from this scenario, you must have administrator access to at least five computers (or virtual machines) that run the Windows Server 2012 operating system.
