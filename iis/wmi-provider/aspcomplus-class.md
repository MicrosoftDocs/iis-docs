# AspComPlus Class
Exposes properties related to COM+.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vbs  
class AspComPlus : EmbeddedObject  
```  
  
## Methods  
 This class contains no methods.  
  
## Properties  
 The following table lists the properties exposed by the `AspComPlus` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`AppServiceFlags`|A read/write `sint32` enumeration that configures certain COM+ features. The possible values are listed later in the Remarks section. The default is 0 (`None`).|  
|`ExecuteInMta`|A read/write `boolean` value. `true` if ASP should run in a multithreaded environment; otherwise, `false`. The default is `false`.|  
|`PartitionId`|A read/write `string` value that specifies the GUID of the COM+ partition. This property is required when `AppServiceFlags` is set to `UsePartition`.|  
|`SxsName`|A read/write `string` value that specifies the name of a COM+ application. This property is required when `AppServiceFlags` is set to `EnableSxS`.|  
|`TrackThreadingModel`|A read/write `boolean` value. `true` if IIS honors the threading model of the components that an application creates; otherwise, `false`. The default is `false`.|  
  
## Subclasses  
 This class contains no subclasses.  
  
## Remarks  
 Instances of this class are contained in the `ComPlus` property of the [AspSection](../wmi-provider/aspsection-class.md) class.  
  
 The following table lists the possible values for the `AppServiceFlags` property. The default is 0 (`None`).  
  
|Value|Keyword|Description|  
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|  
|0|`None`|No COM+ application flags are enabled.|  
|1|`EnableTracker`|Enables the COM+ tracker, which enables ASP applications to be debugged.|  
|2|`EnableSxS`|Enables COM+ side-by-side assemblies, which enable ASP applications to specify which version of a system DLL or COM component (such as MDAC, MFS, MSVCRT, or MSXML) to use.|  
|4|`UsePartition`|Enables COM+ partitioning, which you can use to isolate applications into their own COM+ partitions. If you set this flag, you must also specify a value for the `PartitionID` property.|
