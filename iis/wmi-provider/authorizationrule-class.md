## Syntax  
  
```vbs  
class AuthorizationRule : CollectionElement  
```  
  
## Methods  
 This class contains no methods.  
  
## Properties  
 The following table lists the properties exposed by the `AuthorizationRule` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`AccessType`|A read/write `sint32` enumeration that specifies whether access to a URL resource is granted based on the combination of values specified by the `Roles`, `Users`, and `Verbs` properties. The possible values are listed later in the Remarks section. **Note:**  At run time, the authorization module iterates through `AuthorizationRule` elements until it finds the first rule that fits a particular user. It then grants or denies access to a URL resource depending on the value of the `AccessType` property.|  
|`Roles`|A required unique read/write `string` value that contains a comma-delimited list of roles for which access to a URL resource is granted or denied. A key property. **Note:**  There must be at least one value in either the `Users` property or the `Roles` property, or both.|  
|`Users`|A required unique read/write `string` value that contains a comma-delimited list of users for whom access to a URL resource is granted or denied. The default is "\*". A key property. **Note:**  There must be at least one value in either the `Users` property or the `Roles` property, or both.|  
|`Verbs`|A required unique read/write `string` value that contains a comma-delimited list of HTTP transmission methods for which access to a URL resource is granted or denied. A key property.|
