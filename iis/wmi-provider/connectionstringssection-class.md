# ConnectionStringsSection Class
Specifies a collection of database connection strings for [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../wmi-provider/includes/vstecasp-md.md)] applications.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vbs  
class ConnectionStringsSection : ConfigurationSectionWithCollection  
```  
  
## Methods  
 The following table lists the methods exposed by the `ConnectionStringsSection` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[Add](../wmi-provider/configurationsectionwithcollection-add-method.md)|(Inherited from [ConfigurationSectionWithCollection](../wmi-provider/configurationsectionwithcollection-class.md).)|  
|[Clear](../wmi-provider/configurationsectionwithcollection-clear-method.md)|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSectionWithCollection`.)|  
|[Get](../wmi-provider/configurationsectionwithcollection-get-method.md)|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSectionWithCollection`.)|  
|[GetAllowDefinition](../wmi-provider/configurationsection-getallowdefinition-method.md)|(Inherited from [ConfigurationSection](../wmi-provider/configurationsection-class.md).)|  
|[GetAllowLocation](../wmi-provider/configurationsection-getallowlocation-method.md)|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.)|  
|[Remove](../wmi-provider/configurationsectionwithcollection-remove-method.md)|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSectionWithCollection`.)|  
|[RevertToParent](../wmi-provider/configurationsection-reverttoparent-method.md)|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.)|  
|[SetAllowDefinition](../wmi-provider/configurationsection-setallowdefinition-method.md)|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.)|  
|[SetAllowLocation](../wmi-provider/configurationsection-setallowlocation-method.md)|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.)|  
  
## Properties  
 The following table lists the properties exposed by the `ConnectionStringsSection` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`ConnectionStrings`|An array of [ConnectionStringSettings](../wmi-provider/connectionstringsettings-class.md) values that contain database connection strings for [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../wmi-provider/includes/vstecasp-md.md)] applications and features.|  
|`Location`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.) A key property.|  
|`Path`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.) A key property.|  
|`SectionInformation`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.)|  
  
## Subclasses  
 This class contains no subclasses.  
  
## Remarks  
 In [!INCLUDE[vstecasplong](../wmi-provider/includes/vstecasplong-md.md)], features such as Session, Membership, Personalization, and Role Manager rely on connection strings that are stored in the `ConnectionStrings` property. You can also use the `ConnectionStrings` property to store connection strings for your own applications.
