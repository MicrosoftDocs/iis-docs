## Properties  
 The following table lists the properties exposed by the `GlobalizationSection` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`Culture`|An optional read/write `string` value that specifies the default culture for processing incoming Web requests. For valid culture strings, see the [System.Globalization.CultureInfo](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=67222) class. You can also set this property to "auto". **Note:**  This property is new in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../wmi-provider/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].|  
|`EnableBestFitResponseEncoding`|An optional read/write `boolean` value. `true` if the best-fit character encoding for a response is enabled; otherwise, `false`. The default is `false`. **Note:**  This property is new in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../wmi-provider/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].|  
|`EnableClientBasedCulture`|An optional read/write `boolean` value. `true` if the `Culture` and `UICulture` properties should be based on the `AcceptLanguage` header field value that is sent by the client browser; otherwise, `false`. The default is `false`.<br /><br /> The `AcceptLanguage` header specifies the language that a given browser prefers. **Note:**  This property is new in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../wmi-provider/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].|  
|`FileEncoding`|An optional read/write `string` value that specifies the default encoding for .aspx, .asmx, and .asax file parsing. Unicode and UTF-8 files that are saved with the byte order mark prefix are automatically recognized, regardless of the value of this property. **Note:**  This property is new in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../wmi-provider/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].|  
|`Location`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.) A key property.|  
|`Path`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.) A key property.|  
|`RequestEncoding`|An optional read/write `string` value that specifies the assumed encoding of each incoming request, including posted data and the query string. The default is "UTF-8".<br /><br /> If the request includes a request header that contains an `Accept-Charset` attribute, it overrides this property value in the configuration. **Note:**  The default encoding is specified in the globalization section of the Machine.config file that was created when the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../wmi-provider/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] was installed. If response encoding is not specified in a Machine.config or Web.config file, encoding is set to the default Regional Options locale for the computer. This property is new in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../wmi-provider/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].|  
|`ResourceProviderFactoryType`|An optional read/write `string` value that specifies the factory type of the resource provider.|  
|`ResponseEncoding`|An optional read/write `string` value that specifies the content encoding of responses. The default is "UTF-8". **Note:**  The default encoding is specified in the globalization section of the Machine.config file that was created when the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../wmi-provider/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] was installed. If response encoding is not specified in a Machine.config or Web.config file, encoding is set to the default Regional Options locale for the computer. This property is new in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../wmi-provider/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].|  
|`ResponseHeaderEncoding`|An optional read/write `string` value that specifies the header encoding of HTTP responses. The default is "UTF-8". **Note:**  This property is new in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../wmi-provider/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].|  
|`SectionInformation`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.)|  
|`UICulture`|An optional read/write `string` value that specifies the default culture for processing locale-dependent resource searches. For valid culture strings, see the [System.Globalization.CultureInfo](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=67222) class. You can also set this property to "auto". **Note:**  This property is new in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../wmi-provider/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].|
