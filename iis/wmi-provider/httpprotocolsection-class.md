## Properties  
 The following table lists the properties exposed by the `HttpProtocolSection` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`AllowKeepAlive`|A `boolean` value. `true` if IIS keeps client/server connections open across multiple requests to the server; otherwise, `false`. The default is `true`.<br /><br /> An open connection improves performance when a client makes multiple requests for Web page content. If this property is `false`, the server has to open a new connection for every request. **Note:**  You must use an HTTP `Keep-Alive` header when you use integrated security or connection-based authentication services such as Integrated Windows authentication.|  
|`CustomHeaders`|A [CustomHeaderSettings](../wmi-provider/customheadersettings-class.md) value that contains name/value pairs that are added to the HTTP headers in responses from the Web server.|  
|`Location`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.) A key property.|  
|`Path`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.) A key property.|  
|`RedirectHeaders`|A [RedirectHeaderSettings](../wmi-provider/redirectheadersettings-class.md) value that contains redirect name/value pairs that are added to the HTTP headers in responses from the Web server.|  
|`SectionInformation`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.)|
