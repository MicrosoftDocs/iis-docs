# Object Class1
Serves as a base class from which to derive the primary namespace objects for the [!INCLUDE[iisver](../wmi-provider/includes/iisver-md.md)] WMI provider.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vbs  
class Object  
```  
  
## Methods  
 This class contains no methods.  
  
## Properties  
 This class contains no properties.  
  
## Subclasses  
 The following table lists the classes derived from the `Object` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[AppDomain](../wmi-provider/appdomain-class.md)|Represents an IIS application domain.|  
|[ApplicationPool](../wmi-provider/applicationpool-class.md)|Represents an IIS application pool.|  
|[ConfiguredObject](../wmi-provider/configuredobject-class.md)|Acts as a base type for namespace objects whose configuration can be specified in configuration sections.|  
|[HttpRequest](../wmi-provider/httprequest-class.md)|Represents an HTTP request in a worker process.|  
|[Server](../wmi-provider/server-class.md)|Exposes default configuration settings for applications, application pools, Web sites, and virtual directories on a Web server running IIS.|  
|[SSLBinding](../wmi-provider/sslbinding-class.md)|Represents a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) binding.|  
|[WorkerProcess](../wmi-provider/workerprocess-class.md)|Represents a Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) worker process (w3wp.exe).|  
  
## Remarks  
 Although the `Object` class is not directly useful for scripting, it enables the WMI CIM Studio tool to conveniently group `WebAdministration` classes. CIM Studio is a utility that you can use to view WMI classes, properties, qualifiers, and instances. It is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=72615) as part of WMITools.exe suite of WMI Administrative Tools.
