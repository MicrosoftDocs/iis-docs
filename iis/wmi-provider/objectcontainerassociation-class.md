## Subclasses  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[ApplicationContainsVirtualDirectory](../wmi-provider/applicationcontainsvirtualdirectory-class.md)|Provides a relationship between an IIS application and its virtual directories.|  
|[ApplicationPoolContainsApplication](../wmi-provider/applicationpoolcontainsapplication-class.md)|Provides a relationship between an application pool and its applications.|  
|[ApplicationPoolContainsProcess](../wmi-provider/applicationpoolcontainsprocess-class.md)|Provides a relationship between an application pool and its worker processes.|  
|[ServerContainsApplicationPool](../wmi-provider/servercontainsapplicationpool-class.md)|Provides a relationship between a Web server and its application pools.|  
|[ServerContainsSite](../wmi-provider/servercontainssite-class.md)|Provides a relationship between a Web server and its Web sites.|  
|[ServerContainsSSLBinding](../wmi-provider/servercontainssslbinding-class.md)|Provides a relationship between a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) binding and a Web server that is running IIS.|  
|[SiteContainsApplication](../wmi-provider/sitecontainsapplication-class.md)|Provides a relationship between a Web site and its applications.|  
|[SiteUsesSSLBinding](../wmi-provider/siteusessslbinding-class.md)|Provides a relationship between an IIS Web site and a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) binding.|  
|[WorkerProcessContainsAppDomain](../wmi-provider/workerprocesscontainsappdomain-class.md)|Provides a relationship between a worker process and its application domains.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This base class allows one member of the [Object](../wmi-provider/object-class.md) class to contain another member of the `Object` class. The containing object (for example, [Site](../wmi-provider/site-class.md)) is called a *container*, and the contained object (for example, [Application](../wmi-provider/application-class.md)) is called an *element*. A container object may contain one or more elements. `ObjectContainerAssociation` classes are useful because they enable you to create intuitive parent/child associations that would otherwise be difficult to implement in the relatively flat WMI namespace.
