# PeriodicRestartSettings Class
Specifies the conditions under which worker processes will be recycled.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vbs  
class PeriodicRestartSettings : EmbeddedObject  
```  
  
## Methods  
 This class contains no methods.  
  
## Properties  
 The following table lists the properties exposed by the `PeriodicRestartSettings` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`Memory`|A read/write `uint32` value that specifies the amount of virtual memory, in kilobytes, that a worker process can use before the worker process recycles. The maximum value is 4,294,967. The default is 0 kilobytes, which means that the amount of virtual memory that a worker process uses will not be a condition for recycling the worker process.|  
|`PrivateMemory`|A read/write `uint32` value that specifies the amount of private memory, in kilobytes, that a worker process can use before the worker process recycles. The maximum value is 4,294,967. The default is 0 kilobytes, which means that the amount of private memory that a worker process uses will not be a condition for recycling the worker process.|  
|`Requests`|A read/write `uint32` value that indicates the number of requests an out-of-process application should process before it is recycled. The default is 0, which means that the number of requests an out-of-process application handles will not be a condition for recycling it.|  
|`Schedule`|An array of [ScheduleElement](../wmi-provider/scheduleelement-class.md) values that specify the local times at which an application will be recycled.|  
|`Time`|A read/write `datetime` value that specifies the amount of time before IIS recycles an isolated out-of-process application. The default value is 0, which disables the recycling.|  
  
## Subclasses  
 This class contains no subclasses.  
  
## Remarks  
 Instances of this class are contained in the `PeriodicRestart` property of the [RecyclingSettings](../wmi-provider/recyclingsettings-class.md) class.
