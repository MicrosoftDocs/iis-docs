# SoapExtensionTypeElement Class
Specifies a SOAP extension used to inspect or modify a SOAP message during processing on the Web service or client.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vbs  
class SoapExtensionTypeElement : CollectionElement  
```  
  
## Methods  
 This class contains no methods.  
  
## Properties  
 The following table lists the properties exposed by the `SoapExtensionTypeElement` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`Group`|A read-only `sint32` value that, together with the `Priority` property, specifies the relative order in which a SOAP extension runs when multiple SOAP extensions are configured to run. The possible values are listed later in the Remarks section. A key property.|  
|`Priority`|A read-only `sint32` value that, together with the `Group` property, specifies the relative order in which a SOAP extension runs when multiple SOAP extensions are configured to run. Within each group, the priority attribute distinguishes the overall relative priority of the SOAP extension. A lower priority number indicates a higher priority for the SOAP extension. The lowest possible value for the priority attribute is 1. The maximum value is 2147483647. A key property.|  
|`Type`|A read-only `string` value that specifies the fully qualified type name of a SOAP extension class. When the assembly is put in the global assembly cache, the string must also include the version, culture, and public key token of the signed assembly. A key property.|  
  
## Subclasses  
 This class contains no subclasses.  
  
## Remarks  
 Instances of this class are contained in the `SoapExtensionTypes` array property of the [SoapExtensionTypesInfo](../wmi-provider/soapextensiontypesinfo-class.md) class.
