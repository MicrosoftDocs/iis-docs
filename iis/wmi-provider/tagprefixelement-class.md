|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`Assembly`|A read-only `string` value that specifies the name of the assembly in which a custom control implementation resides. This property applies only to custom controls and is not required if the control is in the application code directory. A key property.|

|`TagName`|A read-only `string` value that specifies the name of a user control. This property applies only to user controls. This is the value follows the tag prefix in the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../wmi-provider/includes/vstecasp-md.md)] code (for example, "myControl" in \<myTag: myControl />). A key property.|  
|`TagPrefix`|A read-only `string` value that specifies the tag prefix that is associated with a source file (or namespace and assembly) where the control resides. This property applies to both user and custom controls. This is the value that precedes the tag name in the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../wmi-provider/includes/vstecasp-md.md)] code (for example, "myTag" in \<myTag: myControl />). The default is "/".
