# TraceUrl Class
Configures the failed-request tracing for a specific request path.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vbs  
class TraceUrl : CollectionElement  
```  
  
## Methods  
 This class contains no methods.  
  
## Properties  
 The following table lists the properties exposed by the `TraceUrl` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`CustomActionExe`|A read/write `string` value that specifies an executable file to run when a failure condition is reached (for example, to run a VBScript file, specify "cscript.exe"). All command-line variables will be expanded. For example, "%windir%" will be expanded to the path of the Windows directory. **Note:**  The executable file will run only if the limit specified in the `CustomActionTriggerLimit` property has not been reached in the worker process.|  
|`CustomActionParams`|A read/write `string` value that contains parameters to pass to the executable file specified in the `CustomActionExe` property. Command-line variables such as "%windir%" will be expanded. You may also use parameter variables such as "%1" and "%2" in the string that you specify (for example, "MyScript.vbs %1 %2").|  
|`CustomActionTriggerLimit`|A read/write `uint32` value that specifies the maximum number of times the program specified by the `CustomActionExe` property will execute during the lifetime of the worker process for the failed-request definition. This value resets every time that the worker process recycles. Permissible values are from 0 through 10000. The default is 1. This feature can be used, for example, to create a memory dump after the next failure but not after subsequent failures. **Note:**  If the `CustomActionTriggerLimit` value that you specify is reached during the run time of the worker process, subsequent failed requests will be logged, but the program specified in `CustomActionExe` will not run. The entries in the failed-requests log will indicate that the `CustomActionTriggerLimit` value has been reached.|  
|`FailureDefinitions`|A read/write [FailureDefinition](../wmi-provider/failuredefinition-class.md) object that specifies the conditions under which a request trace is generated.|  
|`Path`|A required unique read/write `string` value that contains the path of the request to be traced (for example, "*.aspx"). This path is relative to the virtual directory, does not allow subpaths, and can contain only one wildcard (\*). The `Path` property is similar to the `path` attribute in the `<handlers>` section of the ApplicationHost.config file. The key property.|  
|`TraceAreas`|A [TraceUrlAreaSettings](../wmi-provider/traceurlareasettings-class.md) value that specifies areas whose requests are traced.|  
  
## Subclasses  
 This class contains no subclasses.
