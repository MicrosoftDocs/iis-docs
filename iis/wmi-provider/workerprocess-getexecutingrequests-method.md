For Each oW3WP In oW3WPs  
  
    ' Place the requests queued for a process into an array.  
    oW3WP.GetExecutingRequests arrReqs  
  
    ' Show the number of queued requests.  
    If IsNull(arrReqs) Then  
        WScript.Echo "No currently executing requests."

        ' Display the number of requests.  
        WScript.Echo "Number of currently executing requests: " & _
