## Properties  
 The following table lists the properties exposed by the `XmlSerializerSection` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`CheckDeserializeAdvances`|A read/write `Boolean` value. `true` if the progress of the [XmlSerializer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70923) is checked; otherwise, `false`. The default is `false`. **Note:**  By default, the `XmlSerializer` provides an additional layer of security against potential denial of service attacks when untrusted data is deserialized. It does so by attempting to detect infinite loops during deserialization. If such a condition is detected, an exception is thrown with the following message: "Internal error: deserialization failed to advance over underlying stream." This message does not necessarily indicate that a denial of service attack is in progress. In some rare circumstances, the infinite loop detection mechanism produces a false positive and the exception is thrown for a legitimate incoming message. If you find in your particular application that legitimate messages are being rejected by this extra layer of protection, set the `CheckDeserializeAdvances` property to `false`.|  
|`Location`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.) A key property.|  
|`Path`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.) A key property.|  
|`SectionInformation`|(Inherited from `ConfigurationSection`.)|
